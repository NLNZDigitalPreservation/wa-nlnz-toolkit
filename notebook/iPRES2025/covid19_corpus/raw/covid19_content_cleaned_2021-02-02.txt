In summer New Zealanders travel around the country, socialise, and go to large events, increasing the possible spread of COVID-19 in the community. During the holidays, this can make any response more challenging — but we’ve got a plan. Our plan outlines how to reduce the risk of, get ready for and respond to new COVID-19 cases. How we will reduce the risk of, get ready for and respond to new COVID-19 cases. What you can do to reduce the risk of new COVID-19 cases: How we will ready our toolkit. How we would respond if resurgence happens. Community case confirmed and transmission risk assessed. If needed, Ministry of Health COVID-19 Resurgence Plan and National Resurgence Response Plan activated. The location and extent of outbreak risk is assessed. A central government leadership group decides if no further action is required, or monitors the situation, or activates response system. If the response system is activated, a team of central and local government, iwi and community leaders work with local Civil Defence and Emergency Management to manage the outbreak, including: COVID-19 is a tricky virus — we’ve learned a lot from our experience so far, but we all have a part to play in stopping the spread. Our ‘test, trace and isolate’ approach focuses on being able to test lots of people and quickly trace and isolate contacts. We cannot predict where or how a new case might appear in the community, but we’ve done a lot of planning to handle a wide range of possible situations. While any response will depend on the circumstances such as the location or timing, it’s useful to think of 3 scenarios over summer.

Two cases who completed their managed isolation in the same facility and at the same time as the Northland case are now confirmed COVID-19 infections. The two positive cases completed quarantine on 15 January and have been residing in North Auckland since. On 24 January, the Ministry of Health reported that a positive case of COVID-19 had been detected in Northland. The positive COVID-19 case recently completed their stay in Auckland managed isolation facility, The Pullman Hotel. Before they tested positive, the case visited some locations in Northland and Auckland regions. Find out what you need to do if you visited these locations around the same time. If you are concerned about the recent COVID-19 case, you can call Healthline for support and advice about getting tested. 0800 358 5453  Locations of interest for the two Auckland cases and the earlier Northland case are available on the Ministry of Health website. Anyone who visited one of the listed locations during the relevant timeframes is considered to be a COVID-19 ‘casual contact’. While the risk is most often very low, if you visited one of the listed locations at the times stated, you need to do the following: There is very high demand for tests from people who have not been to locations of interest, are not symptomatic and who are not the priority for testing.

To stop any future spread of COVID-19, we need to trace the contacts of anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and break the chain of transmission. Contact tracing helps us do that. All people on-site should sign in using either the QR code or an alternative contact tracing system. This includes employees, customers and other visitors. Make sure it’s done every day, including weekends and after hours. People who sign in with the NZ COVID Tracer app don’t need to use an alternative system. All workplaces and businesses legally must display an NZ COVID Tracer QR code for each location. This applies at all Alert Levels. Get your QR code poster  At Alert Level 2 and higher, you legally must have an alternative system for people who do not use the NZ COVID Tracer app. You may be contacted if your business is a potential contact. Petrol stations, supermarkets and transport stations only need to record people who work on the premises. You do not need an alternative system at Alert Level 1, but it's still a good idea to have one. There are different systems and processes you can use to keep a record, like: We recommend that records include the person’s name, phone number, and the date and time they enter. Whatever you use, it’s important that everyone’s personal details are collected, kept and used in a way that protects their privacy. Previous visitors’ records should not be visible to other visitors. Unsecured personal information exposes people to unwelcome contact, fraud or even identity theft. It’s also a breach of the Privacy Act. Keep these records for at least 30 days. You should only collect information if it’s necessary for contact tracing. The purpose of the collection is to help the Ministry of Health to contact a person in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. It’s unnecessary to collect other personal information like identity verification documents or number plates. You should only ask for name, phone number and the date and time of visit. When collecting this information, tell people that it’s being collected to support contact tracing. It’s your responsibility to store any private information securely, and it can only be used for COVID-19 contact tracing. For example, you should not automatically add people’s emails to your contact database without their consent. We recommend you display a privacy statement alongside your alternative system. For example: This information is being collected to assist in the management of COVID-19. It will be given to the Ministry of Health and/or the District Health Board on request if it is required for contact tracing purposes. We will not use it for any other purpose, and will destroy it after 30 days. It will be kept here at [name of the establishment]. You have a right to access and correct any information we hold about you. You can use these templates as your alternative system. Print whichever template suits your workplace best — you can use both if you wish. A page of individual ballot entries that visitors can fill out and put in a ballot box. You’ll need to cut out each entry for visitors to write on, and have your own ballot box to put them in.

You legally must display a code at any place where work is being carried out. This includes any place where a worker goes, or is likely to be, while at work. While QR codes are linked to a unique location, this does not have to be a fixed location. For example, you can get a QR code for a work vehicle. The NZ COVID Tracer app is our fastest way of responding to the virus — the faster we respond, the faster we stop it. The app also keeps people informed of the risk. While displaying a QR code is not mandatory in these situations, we still encourage community organisations to display a QR code. This includes: Clubs that operate under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 must still display a QR code.

Find nearby clinics by going to Find-a-Vet (external link) If you're self-isolating, you must contact your veterinarian before visiting them or they visit you including for production animals. This applies even if your animal is being presented by someone else. There remains no evidence that domestic animals, pets or livestock can spread COVID-19 and routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not justified. However, it’s good practice to wash your hands before and after interacting with animals. We recommend people sick with COVID-19 avoid contact with pets and other animals, as they would with people. This is based on international advice. Where there's COVID-19 in a household, we recommend animals are not moved off the property. Travel is allowed for essential personal movement in your area, including for accessing local services and businesses. When travelling to deliver an animal, such as a puppy, you'll need to ensure that safe practices are implemented. For example, ensuring a safe distance between all people involved in transporting and receiving the animal, and practicing good hygiene practices, such as hand washing. You cannot travel to another region to personally deliver an animal as part of a sale or adoption. However, transporting the animal as freight with a commercial pet transport company is available. This will likely be via land transport. Check with commercial providers. Travel to care for your animals, including horses, is allowed. This includes providing your animals with food, water, exercise and any other aspect that you need to provide to meet your responsibilities under the Animal Welfare Act and relevant codes of welfare. If your animals are in another region that's not in your local area, try to get someone else you trust to provide care if possible. If your horses are in other people’s care, like at a stable or graziers, in your local area then you can visit them, with certain guidelines. You can visit your horses to provide them with care and exercise. You must maintain physical distance from others. If your horses are in other people’s care, and are not in your region, then you should avoid visiting them. Whenever you visit or exercise your horses, make sure you practise good hygiene measures and physical distancing. A roster system for horse owners to visit the facility may be 1 measure that could be implemented to meet this requirement and to ensure contact tracing is easily achievable. The facility must record everyone that is working there, and every visitor and contractor who enters. Limit visits to what is necessary.

It’s important we look after ourselves and our whānau over the festive season and summer holidays. Warning: video contains flashing images. Please look away if you have a history of photosensitive epilepsy or suffer from migraines. As New Zealanders we cherish our annual summer holidays. We all want an uninterrupted summer — uninterrupted by the weather and uninterrupted by COVID-19. While we cannot control the weather, we can control COVID-19. Here are four simple things we can all do to keep each other safe and make our summer unstoppable. Scanning QR codes with the NZ COVID Tracer app keeps us 1 step ahead of the virus — the more we scan the safer we’ll be. Scanning QR codes wherever you go is especially important when on holiday because you might not remember all the places you visit. Keep your phone handy to make scanning in quick and easy, especially when shops are crowded over Christmas and New Year. Taking a few seconds to scan means we can quickly let you know when you have visited a place where you may have been exposed to the virus. You can then take steps to protect yourself and your whānau. If you do not use the app, use whatever method works for you, like the NZ COVID Tracer booklet. How to keep track of where you’ve been Bluetooth tracing allows you to receive an alert if you’ve been near another app user who tests positive for COVID-19. Bluetooth tracing is great for large gatherings and events, like music festivals, when you’re surrounded by people you do not know. Bluetooth tracing does not replace the need to scan NZ COVID Tracer QR codes. You still need to scan QR codes to keep track of where you’ve been. Bluetooth tracing is an added tool — it helps keep track of the people we’ve been near. When you turn on Bluetooth tracing, your privacy is always protected — it cannot share your location, your name or anything else about you. Turn on Bluetooth tracing Do not travel or take part in activities if you’re unwell. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s critical you stay at home and recover. If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms while on you’re on holiday, do not wait until you get home. Call Healthline or your doctor or Nurse Practitioner to see about getting a test. COVID-19 testing services will continue over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. If you’re away from home, you’ll still be able to access tests. By getting a test, you’re helping keep the community safe. Stay home if you’re sick COVID-19 symptoms Washing your hands is 1 of the easiest ways to keep yourself safe. Wash often. Use soap. 20 seconds. Then dry. This kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. Wash your hands       Many of us will be travelling around New Zealand and going to big events this summer. Shops will be more crowded than usual, and we’ll be going to more social gatherings. Here are some things you can do over our first summer under COVID-19 conditions: Get resources to help your business or event make summer unstoppable. The resources include posters, templates, social media tiles and digital banners. Unstoppable summer toolkit Get support

Annemarie is a former ICU nurse who responded to the call by the Nursing Council of New Zealand for ex-nurses to help with the COVID-19 pandemic response. The Lakes district health board (DHB) nursing team were given 12 hours’ notice to set up the first of 2 managed isolation facilities in Rotorua. She says there is a lot of misunderstanding in the community about what they do. While she is on the frontline of a ‘Viral World War’, they have the right equipment and processes to protect the public. Her Rotorua team has been working hard to educate the community and demystify their work in Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ). Annemarie will be spending her summer working with her 450 Rotorua nursing, Defence Force and security colleagues to continue to keep the community safe. The Waikato district health board Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) Cultural Intervention Team welcomes and supports arrivals in MIQ in accordance with the manaakitanga (hospitality) of Waikato people. Their work supports every facet of Tikanga Māori, from welcoming returning guests, completing assessments, supporting those experiencing bereavement and trauma, and providing karakia and a safe space to korero. Activities offered include online Zumba fitness sessions, flax weaving, Mau Rakau (Māori martial arts) and te reo Māori classes. During the lockdown, the cultural team provided support to all ethnicities. Despite all the work they and the wider MIQ team does to protect New Zealand, its team leader, Ikimoke Tamaki-Takarei, says staff are often stigmatised in the community, despite the very strict health guidelines they work to. Maysa is the host of Bel A’arabee, a weekly Free FM radio show and podcast. She saw a much-needed opportunity to get relevant COVID-19 information delivered quickly, and she worked hard to translate the content for New Zealand’s Arabic-speaking communities. Maysa translated the Prime Minister’s COVID-19 media conferences, recording them in Arabic for broadcasting and podcasting on Free FM by 5pm each day. When Free FM went into lockdown, she continued to produce her programme from home. Her fellow broadcasters at Free FM are proud of her commitment and achievement in making each day’s information delivered quickly to the Arabic speaking communities. www.freefm.org.nz (external link) Sara is a Chinese language journalist and broadcaster. She worked at WTV, an Auckland-based Chinese language television station where she translated Unite against COVID-19 information for Chinese viewers. Sara’s broadcasts helped keep the mainly Mandarin-speaking communities in touch and up to date with Alert Level changes. Sara has a YouTube channel which she uses to entertain people and keep give them advice on all manner of subjects. She has even made one on the Make Summer Unstoppable theme.

During lockdown, the Trust contacted vulnerable people with a special focus on elderly individuals who lived alone. Trust volunteers carried out food deliveries and provided financial assistance by assisting with Ministry of Social Development (MSD) grants. Volunteers also supported vulnerable people and families emotionally and socially to make them feel safe and stronger. The Trust opened an op-shop to help supply affordable winter and summer clothing to those affected by the closure of workplaces and the loss of work contracts and hours.

During the lockdown last year, she was active in her community, translating and broadcasting important COVID-19 messaging on the weekly radio show and podcast. She also delivered food parcels, food vouchers, hygiene packs and face coverings to over 200 families and 10 churches in the Christchurch area. Many of the struggling families and individuals had contacted her through her radio show. Lepou intends to resume her broadcasting over the summer, translating Unite Against COVID-19 information and news for her community of listeners.

During the lockdown, its services experienced a spike in demand on its Asian Helpline number, with many callers needing psychological, medical and informational support. Many clients are vulnerable, non-English speaking older people with long-term health conditions and/or mobility limitations who became completely isolated during the lockdown. AFS provides services in Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Hindi. During 2020, it worked with 2,834 clients, carried out 6,101 interventions and took 3,215 Helpline calls.

The Warehouse at Sylvia Park, which Graham manages, became a vital source of essential supplies requested by government agencies during the lockdown. Following the request from government, Graham and his team moved quickly to rearrange the shop, so it was fit for purpose to pack orders for requested products. Every day, they would receive an email with a list of required items which the team needed to locate within the store and package. Team members would grab shopping trolleys to collect the requested stock from the shelves and then box them up for delivery. Graham liaised with government agencies throughout Alert Levels 4 and 3 to maintain supply lines. He also ensured his team remained motivated, upbeat, connected and above all else, safe.  The CNSST Foundation (formerly known as the Chinese New Settlers Services Trust) provides services to Asian new settlers, including settlement orientation, educational and work programmes, and social housing. The Foundation’s Social Housing Team worked hard to protect a vulnerable group of people — elderly people, particularly the 51 residents who live in its social housing apartment. The team is continuing its work over the summer by providing information and services, including distributing personal protective equipment (PPE), to keep its elderly residents connected and safe. Find out more about The CNSST Foundation (external link)  Team TANI has been fully committed to responding to the increased community needs of Asian peoples in the Auckland region during the COVID-19 crisis. It did this by providing the most up-to-date information for accessing relevant public health, social support and mental well-being services. The team also initiated online wellbeing programs to support Asian communities during a challenging year and will continue that work in 2021.

Some people may also have less common symptoms such as only: If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline or your iwi health provider. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and call: A health professional will advise whether you fit the criteria for testing. Call your doctor before visiting if you have any symptoms. Let your health professional know if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case. If you’re outside New Zealand call +64 9 358 5453 or your doctor. Information about testing for COVID-19 Like the flu, COVID-19 is usually spread from person to person. People can catch the virus through their eyes, nose or mouth. Scientific evidence suggests that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may spread droplets containing the virus. People may get infected by the virus if they touch surfaces or objects that have been touched by an infected person, or if droplets have settled there. People could also get infected if droplets remain in the air for a few minutes, or longer. While it is unlikely people will get infected this way, the risk becomes higher: That’s why it’s really important to use good hygiene, at any time. Last updated: 21 January 2021 Get support

If you have symptoms and get tested, stay home until you have a negative test result. COVID-19 tests are free of charge. This applies whether you have symptoms of COVID-19 or not, and regardless of your citizenship, immigration status, nationality or level of medical insurance coverage. You may need to pay for a test if it’s for the purpose of entering another country. Getting a pre-departure COVID-19 test If you are asked to pay for a COVID-19 test, please report it to your district health board or primary health organisation. You will not be charged for your care if you test positive. You will need to provide contact details so that your results can be sent to you. You do not need to have an NHI number or ID to get tested. But it’s helpful to have your NHI number with you when you get tested. How to find your NHI number (external link) You can ask someone to help you get to your test and be with you during your test. If you are very unwell and advised by Healthline or your doctor that you need to be assessed or tested at a hospital, you can ask someone to help you get there. If you need someone with you at the hospital, you or your support person should call ahead and discuss this with the doctor or nurse at the hospital. Everyone can get tested — you do not need to be a New Zealand citizen or resident. The test is still free, and you will not be charged for care if you test positive. But, you may need to pay for a test if it’s for the purpose of entering another country. No information will be shared with Immigration New Zealand even if you test positive. When you are tested, you will be told how and when to expect your results. Whether you test negative or positive, you will receive your results. If you test positive, the Ministry of Health and your local public health unit will call you to discuss your results. They will advise you what to do next. What to expect if you test positive If you need to be tested for COVID-19, a sample is taken from you. There’s more than 1 way to take a sample. The most common way is to swab the back of your nose. A swab is like a small cotton-bud but with a longer stick. For some people this is a tickle, others find it a bit uncomfortable. If you get tested, we need your help to keep healthcare workers safe. That means continuing to cough and sneeze into your elbow, and staying 2 metres away from other people wherever possible. Follow any instructions you get, like turning up on time, calling ahead or waiting in your car. The people testing you may wear protective equipment likes gowns or face coverings. This is nothing to worry about, it helps protect them and everyone they’re testing.

Information on getting tested if you work at the border (external link) Some countries require travellers to confirm a negative COVID-19 test before they leave New Zealand. You can check the requirements of the country you are travelling to, by contacting their local high commission, embassy or consulate in New Zealand. Getting a pre-departure COVID-19 test If you’re travelling to New Zealand from the US or UK, you must have a negative COVID-19 test result before the scheduled departure of your first international flight. For travellers from other countries (except those from Australia, Antarctica and most Pacific islands), this came into effect after 11:59pm (NZT) on Monday 25 January. You will need to have had both your COVID-19 sample taken and your result returned no more than 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of your first international departure. Check the requirements for pre-departure testing for travellers to New Zealand The Ministry of Health publishes data on: This data helps us measure New Zealand’s recovery from COVID-19 and how to continue to respond in the best way.

We encourage voluntary and not-for-profit sport and recreation facilities and events to display NZ COVID Tracer app QR codes to assist with contact tracing. Get your QR code poster At Alert Level 1, we still need to play it safe. We all need to be ready in case COVID-19 comes back into the community. To be ready at Alert Level 1: Get more advice on living at Alert Level 1, including keeping your distance, wearing face coverings and contact tracing for businesses At Alert Level 2, you can do your usual sport and recreation activities if you can do them safely. But if you’re sick, stay home. When exercising in public, keep a 2 metre distance from people you don’t know if possible. You can do activities like: At Alert Level 2, you can fish for whitebait as long as you keep a 2 metre physical distance from other fishers. You also need to follow the whitebait regulations. Community sports are limited to groups of 100 in a defined space. Referees, officials and other workers providing services to a sports game are not included in the 100 people. A sports field can have multiple defined spaces by keeping: We recommend groups be prevented from intermingling or sharing common facilities at the same time. For example, a game of rugby can occur so long as there are no more than 100 people on the field. If that field has a stand on either side, up to 100 people can gather in each stand if they are kept separate from those from the other stand and from players and umpires on the field. Organisers and the person in control of the premises are responsible for collecting contact tracing information. Guidelines from Sport New Zealand (external link)  Professional leagues can go ahead at Alert Level 2 because they take place in controlled workplaces. High Performance Sport New Zealand activities can take place at Alert Level 2 using a controlled workplace approach in consultation with WorkSafe. Spectators at professional sports games are limited to groups of 100 in a defined space. Gatherings, events and public venues Exercise and recreation is an important part of maintaining our health and wellbeing. However, there's a very high risk of transmission if we come into contact with others, touch common equipment or surfaces, or need rescuing or medical care. You can do activities that are local and safe. Only exercise alone or with the people in your extended bubble. You need to keep a 2 metre distance from people who aren’t in your bubble, and you are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering. The most important thing is to stay safe. Do low-risk activities, so you don’t need rescuing or medical care. Now is not the time to take up new activities, or expose yourself or your bubble to any risk. Use your common sense — stay local, stay safe. If you’re experienced you can do more activities. These include: Stay within 200 metres from shore if you are kayaking, canoeing, rowing, surfing, wind surfing or paddle boarding. Boating, jet-skiing, yachting and scuba diving is not allowed. Team sports and training is also prohibited. Stick to your local area. For example, go to your nearest beach or park, not your favourite one. You can not stay overnight at a bach or holiday home. If you're exercising outside and it's too busy to keep a 2 metre distance from others, go home — go out later. We recommend driving as short a distance as you can and still do the activity. Find detailed information about sport and recreation under each Alert Level on the Sport New Zealand website (external link) You can hunt on both private and public conservation land. You need to stay within your region and stick to your bubble. Overnight trips are not allowed. You may only hunt on foot — using quad bikes, off-road bikes, helicopters and other motorised vehicles is not allowed. Hunters cannot stay in DOC huts or campgrounds under Alert Level 3 and hunting must also be consistent with the usual local area restrictions. This is not the time to take up hunting as a new hobby. Use your common sense — stay local, stay safe. If you want to go fishing you can do so from a wharf or the shore, but do not cast off the rocks or fish from a boat. Boating is not allowed. You can fish for whitebait at Alert Level 3 during the whitebaiting season. Fish locally, stay 2 metres from other river users and do not use motorised vehicles to get to your fishing spot. You legally must also comply with all current whitebait regulations, including fishing from the banks of rivers or the water’s edge, and do not enter the water or use a boat to fish. You can do conservation volunteer work — including checking trap lines, planting and weeding. We recommend only doing the project if it’s close to home. You need to be able to keep 2 metres from people outside of your bubble. We recommend not organising large volunteer groups. Last updated: 23 September 2020 Get support

Funerals, tangihanga and burials are allowed at Alert Level 3, but are limited to 10 people or under. The 10 person limit includes kaikaranga, kaikōrero, members of the clergy or staff who are attending. Formal tangihanga involving large gatherings cannot take place at Alert Level 3. Up to 10 people in the same bubble may go to view the tūpapaku, the person who has died, by appointment with the funeral director. Other whānau can view the body by appointment, but only in groups of up to 10 from the same bubble. Talk with your funeral director about specific arrangements, including how to maintain physical distance. They can guide you on the best options for your situation, which may include livestreaming or video so others can take part in the service remotely. We recommend no food or drink being served and physical distancing should be maintained between people. If you're attending a funeral or tangihanga we recommend still keeping 2 metres apart from people not in your bubble. You’re strongly encouraged to wear a face covering. At Alert Level 3 you can visit a cemetery in your region, if you can do so safely while maintaining a physical distance from people not in your bubble. The general guidance for avoiding physical contact, including harirū, hongi, kissing, and hugging, remain in place.

Children look to adults for guidance on how to react to stressful events. Parents, caregivers, whānau and teachers have a particularly important part to play in reassuring children at this time. Children will react to and follow your verbal and non-verbal cues. If you stay informed and realistic, it will be easier for you to reassure children effectively as well. They also need to feel that any fears they may have can be talked about and addressed. Let your children talk about their feelings and help reframe their concerns into the appropriate perspective.

It’s normal to feel anxious or stressed in times of difficulty. However, there are lots of things you can do to feel better. There are a number of things we can all do to boost our mental wellbeing and that of our loved ones. This is important for our wellbeing and helps to make us feel safer, less stressed and less anxious. We can support each other through the recovery, by keeping the connections and close ties to others that we forged during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, worried or scared. Allow yourself time to notice and express what you’re feeling. This could be by writing thoughts and feelings down in a journal, talking to others, doing something creative or practising meditation. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you’re feeling. Reach out to others. Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat at regular times, shower, change your clothes, see others regularly, either virtually or in person, and do your chores. Meditating and exercising can help you to relax and have a positive impact on your thoughts. Try not to increase unhealthy habits like comfort eating, drinking, smoking or vaping. Reaching out to those who may be feeling stressed or concerned can benefit both you and the person receiving support. You may find it useful to limit your time online. Check media and social media at specific times once or twice a day.

By getting a test, you're helping keep your community safe. The NZ COVID Tracer app keeps us 1 step ahead of the virus. Using the app will help our health services reach people quickly to stop any possible spread of COVID-19. Please wear a face covering whenever you're on public transport, including flights. Keep your community safe, and cover for each other. Washing your hands is 1 of the easiest ways to keep yourself safe. Wash often. Use soap. 20 seconds. Then dry. This kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. It will keep the virus off your hands, so you won’t spread it to other people and make them sick too. Regularly clean surfaces that get touched frequently. COVID-19 is contained at Alert Level 1, but it’s still worthwhile to keep a safe distance from people you don’t know while out and about. This will help to minimise the spread of COVID-19 if community transmission returns. Maintain physical distancing Get support

The scientific evidence suggests that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. This means that when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus. These droplets quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. COVID-19 can remain on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to about 3 days, and less than that for other types of surfaces. This will depend on the surface. If surfaces look visibly dirty, clean it first. It’s best to use a disinfectant. Use a disinfectant that is antiviral and follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely.

Face masks play an important role in clinical settings, such as hospitals. For people with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, there may be benefit in wearing a face mask to reduce the spread of infection to other people. Coughing or sneezing into your elbow catches the droplets and stops them getting onto your hands. Put any used tissues in the bin or a bag immediately. Then wash your hands thoroughly. Then dry. Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. The scientific evidence confirms that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus.

If someone has COVID-19, the Ministry of Health and district health boards (DHBs) track down people who may have been exposed to the virus. This process is called contact tracing. More about contact tracing at the Ministry of Health (external link) There are 2 types of contacts: Close contacts are those who are likely to be at a higher risk of being infected. A casual contact is anyone exposed to the case who does not meet the criteria for a close contact. Health services give advice to both of these types of contacts on what they need to do. Close and casual contacts, and what they need to do (external link) Locations of interest are places where someone confirmed with COVID-19 visited. If you visited a location of interest at a certain time, you may be classed as a casual contact. The Ministry of Health lists locations of interest and has advice on what you should do if you are a casual contact. Locations of interest in New Zealand (external link) The NZ COVID Tracer app is our fastest way of responding to the virus — the faster we respond, the faster we stop it. The app also keeps people informed of the risk. Usually this is from a test, someone visiting a doctor when ill or calling Healthline. They will be asked if they have used the official NZ COVID Tracer app to scan QR codes: You can help make contact tracing easier for health officials by continuing to keep a record of where you go and who you meet.

The NZ COVID Tracer app helps you protect yourself, your whānau, and your community by enabling faster contact tracing. The NZ COVID Tracer app has been updated to include Bluetooth tracing technology. Bluetooth tracing allows you to receive an alert if you have been near another app user who tests positive for COVID-19. Bluetooth tracing is not intended to replace our existing contact tracing processes or the NZ COVID Tracer QR codes. You still need to scan QR codes to keep track of where you’ve been. Bluetooth tracing is an added tool — it helps keep track of the people we’ve been near. Once you have turned Bluetooth tracing on, it works by sending out a private and secure random ID code. It’s like your phone is giving digital high-fives to other phones you are near. The Bluetooth tracing function records how close the other phone was, and for how long. The phones you come into contact with will need to have Bluetooth tracing turned on as well. This means that when someone tests positive for COVID-19, they can send an anonymous notification containing all the random IDs their phone has sent out over the past 14 days. If your phone recognises any of these IDs, and you had been close enough for long enough to be at risk of exposure, you’ll receive an alert. This alert will advise you on what to do to keep yourself and your whānau safe. Watch our Bluetooth tracing video on this page to see how it works. To enable Bluetooth tracing, go to the dashboard of the NZ COVID Tracer app. You should see a menu item saying whether Bluetooth tracing is on or not. If it’s off, tap the icon to turn it on. Once Bluetooth tracing is enabled in the app, it will work automatically in the background as long as you have your phone’s Bluetooth setting on. If you don’t see a menu item about Bluetooth tracing on the dashboard, you might need to update the app in the App Store or Play Store. Bluetooth tracing will not use any mobile data, and it will not drain your battery because it uses Bluetooth Low Energy. Read more troubleshooting tips (external link) When you enable Bluetooth tracing, your privacy is always protected — it cannot share your location, your name or anything else about you. Bluetooth tracing also does not record who you came into contact with, or where you were. This means if you receive an alert because you came into contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, no one but you knows you have received it. All the contact tracing information you collect with the app is held securely on your phone, and it’s always your choice what information you choose to share. How to enable Bluetooth tracing, device minimum requirements and troubleshooting advice (external link)    Scanning QR codes with the NZ COVID Tracer app keeps us 1 step ahead of the virus — the more we scan the safer we’ll be. Taking a few seconds to scan means we can quickly let you know when you have visited a place where you may have been exposed to the virus. You can then take steps to protect yourself and your whānau. It also means if you test positive for the virus, you can instantly give your digital diary to contact tracers. This gives them a massive head start. The faster we can trace contacts, the faster we can prevent another outbreak of the virus. From 10 December, NZ COVID Tracer will have Bluetooth tracing to anonymously keep track of who you have been near. However, it’s still just as important to keep scanning QR codes to keep track of where you’ve been. Both are important for contact tracing. If you do not use the app, use whatever method works for you, like the NZ COVID Tracer booklet.

This is about physical distance. For your own mental health you can, and should, keep in touch with friends and family via the phone, or online. We are all being asked to play our part to refrain from physical contact to prevent the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 can spread from person to person through physical contact. As well as the impact on New Zealanders generally, this will have an effect on particular areas of tikanga Māori including kawa , as we move to protect our whānau, hapū and iwi. It will particularly affect those who are more vulnerable such as our kaumātua — our koroua and kuia . In practice, for those who do not live together and aren’t family/whānau or close friends, this means suspending our customs of hongi and harirū , as well as kissing, hugging and other forms of close physical contact. Alternatives include waving, smiling or other non-physical contact greetings. Even if you’re wearing a face covering, we recommend still physically distancing. COVID-19 is contained at Alert Level 1, so you do not need to maintain physical distance from others. However, it’s still worthwhile keeping a safe distance from people you don’t know while out and about. This will help minimise the spread of COVID-19 if it reappears in the community. At Alert Level 1, we still need to play it safe. We all need to be ready in case COVID-19 comes back into the community. To be ready at Alert Level 1: Get more advice on living at Alert Level 1, including keeping your distance, wearing face coverings and contact tracing for businesses At Alert Level 2, you can leave home and do many aspects of everyday life. You should follow public health measures and consider others around you. We still need to be careful and socialise safely to keep COVID-19 under control. What we can do: You can socialise at Alert Level 2, but keep track of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen. This is easier if you socialise with people you know well. If you’re feeling sick or have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, we recommend you stay at home and not socialise with anyone. Outside of your home, you legally must continue to keep a 2 metre distance from people at all times. Workers legally must maintain physical distance in the workplace.

If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and call your doctor or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice about getting tested. By getting a test, you’re helping keep your community safe. Testing is always free for everyone. Symptoms include: These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. Some people may also have less common symptoms such as only: If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline or your iwi health provider. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. COVID-19 symptoms Staying at home if you’re sick is the best thing you can do to stop any future spread of COVID-19. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s critical you stay at home and recover. If you’re waiting for COVID-19 test results, and have been told you need to self-isolate, you legally must do so immediately. Self-isolation means staying at home and taking common sense precautions to avoid close contact with those you live with. If somebody you live with develops cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms they should call their regular health professional. If they do not have a regular health professional they can call Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 . If you’re unwell, we recommend not sharing a bed with others. Speak with your family and whānau about sleeping arrangements. Avoid sleeping in a common area until you’re feeling better. Aim to stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Try to keep the window open as much as possible to enable ventilation and airflow as this will help to keep clean air moving through your room. Minimise the time you spend in shared spaces such as bathrooms, kitchens and sitting rooms as much as possible and keep shared spaces clean and well ventilated. While you’re unwell, do not invite or allow social visitors, such as friends, family and whānau, to enter your home. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone or other means of contact. It's okay for friends, family, whānau or delivery drivers to drop off food and supplies. Ask them to leave items at the door. We recommend also avoiding visiting others if you’re unwell. Stay home until you have fully recovered. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups or eating utensils with other people in your home. After using these items, we recommend washing them thoroughly with soap and water, putting them in the dishwasher for cleaning, or washing them in the sink. Use your own toothbrushes, towels, washcloths or bed linen. Do not share food and drinks. Someone in your home can prepare your food, but we recommend not preparing food for others. Wash your clothing and dishes separate to others in your home. Make sure you use separate towels from other people in your house, both for drying yourself after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes. Ask your family and whānau or the people you live with to use their own towels and keep them separate. We recommend doing your own laundry. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with a sick person can be washed with other people’s items. Do not shake dirty laundry. This minimises the possibility of dispersing the virus. It may be easier for someone else to fold and put away clean laundry items such as towels and tea towels. They can also provide a supply of laundry items to you. If you do not have a washing machine, wait until you’re no longer unwell before taking your laundry to a laundrette. If you have been told by a health official to self-isolate and you cannot work from home, your employer can apply for the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme. The scheme means employees and self-employed people receive an income if they cannot work from home while they’re self-isolating. The COVID-19 Leave Support is paid as a lump sum, calculated to cover 2 weeks. Your employer can re-apply for you if you still qualify after 2 weeks. If you work in health, disability or aged-care facilities or services and you have COVID-19 symptoms, your employer can tell you to self-isolate while you wait to get a test or you are waiting for your test results. You will still be eligible for the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme.

Follow these steps to wash your hands properly: The same goes for hand sanitiser, use a sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub it into your hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure full coverage. Wash your hands regularly, especially: Always wash your hands: You can use any temperature of water to wash your hands. As long as you use soap, cold water and warm water both kill germs and viruses. Handwashing with soap and water or using hand sanitiser, when done correctly, are both highly effective at killing most germs and viruses. Hand sanitiser is often more convenient when you’re outside of the home, but can be expensive or difficult to find in emergency contexts. You can make handwashing easier for children by setting up a stool so they can reach water and soap by themselves. You can make it fun for them by singing their favourite songs while you help them rub their hands. Germs spread more easily from wet skin than from dry skin, so drying your hands completely is an important step. Paper towels or clean cloths are the most effective way to remove germs without spreading them to other surfaces. Last updated: 15 September 2020 Get support

A face covering helps stop droplets spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. This includes someone who has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. Face coverings are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings are only 1 part of keeping yourself and others safe. Our strategy to protect New Zealand against COVID-19 is based on our border protections, testing, contact tracing and other public health measures, like washing hands and physical distancing. Face coverings are an extra protective physical barrier to help keep people safe. At Alert Level 1, there is still a risk of COVID-19 returning to the community. We encourage you to wear face coverings on public transport and when you cannot maintain physical distance in crowded indoor places, like in supermarkets. You legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling on a domestic flight anywhere in New Zealand  — this does not include private flights. Be prepared by having a supply of face coverings for everyone who usually lives in your household. Add some to your household emergency kit. Face coverings legally must be worn: Face coverings do not need to be worn: You also do not need to wear face coverings if: Drivers and transport operators will not stop people without face coverings from boarding public transport. This is because some people will have legitimate reasons for not wearing a face covering. However, where possible, drivers will be encouraging passengers to wear a face covering. We know that some people who have a disability or health condition may not be able to wear a face covering safely or comfortably. If you cannot wear one, you can get an exemption card. If you cannot wear a face covering, you can show your exemption card when needed, for example to a bus driver. You do not need to have an exemption card, but you may feel more comfortable showing something official to confirm you cannot wear a face covering. If you think you need an exemption card, call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . You can get a printable version, or a card that you can show on your phone. If these are not suitable, Healthline will talk through other options with you. If you prefer, you can contact the Disabled Persons Assembly NZ on 04 801 9100 or at info@dpa.org.nz At Alert Levels 2 and above the risk of COVID-19 being present in the community is higher. So, wearing a face covering is more important. You legally must wear a face covering on public transport and aircraft at Alert Level 2. This includes trains, buses and ferries. They do not need to be worn: These groups are likely to be in each other’s bubbles as part of a registered group or have space to physically distance where possible. Also, face coverings do not need to be worn: There will be other times when it's not required. For example: Drivers and transport operators will not stop people without face coverings from boarding public transport. This is because some people will have legitimate reasons for not wearing a face covering. However, where possible, drivers will be encouraging passengers to wear a face covering. Children and young people do not need to wear face coverings at school. This is because the risk of infection within the school environment is low. Other public health control measures will be in place including: It’s not mandatory to wear a face covering. Wearing face coverings is advised where it’s not possible to practise physical distancing or to carry out contact tracing. For example, in crowded spaces on Tertiary Education Organisation campuses, or teaching and learning situations where close physical contact cannot be avoided. Teachers do not need to wear face coverings at Alert Level 2. Other public health control measures will be in place including: At Alert Level 2, when not on public transport, we recommend you consider wearing a face covering when you cannot maintain physical distance from people you do not know. At Alert Level 3, the risk of COVID-19 being present in the community is higher. You legally must wear a face covering on public transport and aircraft at Alert Level 3. This includes trains, buses, and ferries. You are also strongly encouraged to wear a face covering when you're outside your home and in a place where it’s hard to stay 2 metres away from other people. When you wear a face covering, it's important you use it safely. How to wear a face covering safely Most people can use non-medical-grade face coverings. These face coverings prevent the wearer from spreading diseases to others and could help protect the wearer from becoming infected. Non-medical-grade face coverings can be either single-use or reusable. Non-medical-grade face coverings do not need to conform to any standard. This means they are not used in medical settings. You can buy non-medical-grade face coverings online or in shops like pharmacies, supermarkets and hardware stores. If you do not have a face covering, you do not need to rush out and buy one. You can use another kind of covering, like a bandana, scarf or t-shirt. How to make a face covering At raised Alert Levels, people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are advised to avoid contact with the public. If you need to go out, and feel you are vulnerable, you may wish to discuss with your health provider whether using a medical mask is best for you. Medical masks are made to be used by healthcare workers. These masks provide a protective barrier between the healthcare worker and the people they are treating to reduce transmission of infectious diseases. They are used in combination with other measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing when required. They are not reusable and must comply with the standard AS 4381:2015, or international equivalent. Surgical masks are worn by healthcare professionals during healthcare procedures. They generally have a higher level of quality testing and are designed to reduce fluid splash and transmission of infectious diseases. The Ministry of Health will make sure there is enough supply and distribution of medical and surgical masks for the wider health sector. Ensuring medical, surgical and N95 (or equivalent) masks are available for healthcare workers and those working in high-risk COVID-19 settings, such as border control, continues to be a priority.

Cut into a square, if it's not already. Fold it from the top inwards a third of the way down. Fold from the bottom inwards, a third of the way up. You should have an rectangle of material, folded into 3 layers. Loop your hair ties or elastic bands over the ends of the folded material. Leave enough room in the middle to comfortably cover your mouth and nose. Fold the outer edges inwards. This adds an extra layer of material over your mouth and nose. It also helps hold the face covering together. Pick up the face covering by the bands. Loop them over 1 ear at a time. Wear the face covering with the join against your face. Make your own face covering with just a handkerchief or t-shirt and 2 hair ties. Cut out 2 rectangles from your tightly woven cotton fabric, each measuring 19.5 cm x 19 cm. Cut out a rectangle from the water-resistant fabric for the middle layer, measuring 19.5 cm x 19 cm. Cut 2 pieces of elastic, each measuring 20 cm long. Take 1 piece of your cotton fabric, with the side you want facing outwards turned up. Pin the ends of the elastic to the sides of your fabric. Make a semi-circle with your elastic so it doesn’t catch when you sew it. Pin the elastic in place. Lay your pieces of cotton fabric together. Make sure the cotton that will be on the outside of your face covering is turned inwards here. Lay the water-resistant fabric on top of your cotton fabric. Pin all the pieces together. Stitch your fabric together with a 6 mm seam allowance. Leave a small opening on one side. Turn the fabric right side out and sew a 3 mm seam around the outside to close the opening and finish the edges neatly. Make 3 evenly spaced folds along the right and left sides of your face covering. Pin these in place.

The Government has been monitoring overseas developments and is concerned about high rates of infection and new variants of the virus and their potential to spread more rapidly. This additional measure reduces the risk of infected travellers on international flights infecting other travellers. The Government now requires all travellers to New Zealand (except those from exempt locations) to have a COVID-19 test taken and a negative result returned within 72 hours of their first scheduled international flight. If you are planning to travel to New Zealand soon, it is a good idea to work out how you will be able to get your pre-departure test results within 72 hours of your departure. Contact your airline for more information about flights and any pre-departure requirements. Some people are exempt from the pre-departure testing requirements. Children under 2 years of age (24 months) do not need to take a pre-departure test. Children over the age of 2 (24 months) will need evidence of a negative pre-departure test. Locations included are Antarctica, Australia, the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna. Locations included are Albania, Belize, Dominica, Kenya, Laos, Montenegro, Myanmar, Slovenia, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. These locations are exempt as they are unable to provide pre-departure testing for travellers to the standard required by New Zealand. Instead, travellers from these locations must obtain a certificate from a suitably qualified health practitioner (or a person who is registered or licensed as an equivalent health professional overseas). This needs to be obtained no more than 72 hours before the journey begins confirming they do not have symptoms which indicate that they are likely to transmit COVID-19. Travellers need to produce this certificate when requested by the following: All arrivals from these locations are still required to complete 14 days in managed isolation. They are also subject to day 0/1, day 3 and day 12 testing during their stay If you cannot take a test due to medical reasons, you will need to see a medical practitioner within 72 hours of your departure. They will examine you for symptoms of COVID-19. If they are confident you do not have symptoms of COVID-19, they will need to provide you a medical certificate stating you cannot take a test due to medical reasons but do not have symptoms. This will be accepted as meeting the pre-departure testing requirements. If you have received a COVID-19 vaccination you will still need to take a test. If you return a positive result, you will need a medical certificate verifying that you are not infectious with COVID-19. You should factor this into your timings, and check with your airlines on any regulations they may have in place regarding vaccinations. On 20 January, the Ministry of Health confirmed the following types of tests are acceptable by the New Zealand Director-General of Health: All tests must be processed by a laboratory recognised in the country of origin as authorised or accredited to conduct tests. If you choose to take an at-home COVID-19 test, it must be processed by a laboratory recognised in the country of origin as authorised or accredited to conduct tests. You should also check the requirements of other countries you are going to be transiting through. They may have requirements that are different to what New Zealand requires. Learn more about the Ministry of Health testing requirements (external link) If you are unable to take a test for medical reasons you are required to provide a medical certificate. A Fit to Fly Certificate will be accepted as proof of pre-departure testing documentation if it is consistent with both the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order requirements and the subsequent Gazetted requirements regarding pre-departure testing. Acceptable Fit to Fly Certificates must contain the following six elements: If your test result record does not provide this information, you may be prevented from boarding the aircraft. Please ensure this information will be provided to you by your testing facility when you get tested. You can get tested at a range of airports, or from private laboratories. We recommend you select a test provider carefully, to make sure you can get tested and get your results in time for your flight departure. You should contact the local health authority of the country that you are in for information about COVID-19 testing locations and booking arrangements (if available). Most health authorities advertise COVID-19 testing locations on their websites. If you have a positive pre-departure test, but believe this is because of a historical COVID-19 infection, you need to see a medical practitioner who will examine you for current symptoms of COVID-19. If they are confident you do not currently have a COVID-19 infection, you will need them to provide a medical certificate with the date of your previous positive test (if applicable) and documentation stating that they consider you as no longer being infectious with COVID-19. It may take time to get an appointment, so if you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 3 months, book your medical examination in advance of receiving your test results. You should also check with your airlines about any regulations they may have in place regarding past COVID-19 infections. If you test positive, you may not be able to board your flight. You should postpone your travel and follow local public health advice. If you choose to travel at a later date when you have recovered, you will be required to get a medical certificate within 72 hours from the time of departure that confirms that you had a positive COVID-19 test but have now recovered. If your negative test result does not arrive in time for your flight, you can reschedule your flight for no more than 24 hours later, even if this takes your test beyond the 72 hours before the scheduled time of your first flight. If your flight is cancelled, the requirement would remain that you need to have had a test with a negative result no more than 72 hours before departure of your new flight. If your flight is delayed by 24 hours or less and you have a negative result, you can still travel, even if it takes your test beyond the 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of your first flight. You need to keep a record of your original scheduled flight for presenting to airline staff and Customs officers. Travellers are responsible for testing costs. You should work with airlines to rebook your flights, and contact Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) about your placement. MIQ is working hard to accommodate travellers that might be impacted by the new testing requirements. If you are impacted by the pre-departure testing requirements you should work with your airline to rebook your flights and contact MIQ for information about your MIQ placement. Contact MIQ about your placement (external link) If you need consular assistance, contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate closest to you or email CONS@mfat.govt.nz For emergency consular assistance, call +64 99 20 20 20 if you’re overseas, or 0800 30 10 30 if you’re in New Zealand. You are responsible for bringing your test results or medical certificate to the airport and providing the required information. Without the information you may be denied boarding and be subject to an infringement fine. Testing labs must be able to issue you a dated report for you to present. It should have: Either a hard copy or an electronic copy (email/text message) of your negative test result, or a Fit to Fly Certificate, will be accepted. A text message will be accepted only if it includes an image of the laboratory result form. Hold on to all documents and treat your negative test results and Managed Isolation voucher with the same importance as your passport — you may be asked to show these as you transit and on arrival in New Zealand. Pre-departure testing is an additional measure to further reduce the risk of new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand, in line with our elimination strategy. It is complementary to existing testing requirements, such as day 0/1 testing, and does not duplicate them. All travellers to New Zealand are required to undergo day 0/1 testing within 24 hours of arriving at a managed isolation and quarantine facility. If you’re asked for evidence of your negative COVID-19 test result or a medical certificate, and you cannot provide it, you may be denied boarding. You will be asked to provide this information to a Customs officer when entering New Zealand. All travellers arriving in New Zealand after 8 February 2021 without evidence of a negative approved test may incur an infringement offence fee or a fine not exceeding $1,000. The pre-departure test is a measure to keep us all safe. Most airlines already require travellers to have a pre-departure test and provide evidence of a negative result before boarding a plane. Pre-departure tests are also a legal requirement for most countries that are transit hubs. Last updated: 24 January 2021 at 11:50 pm Get support

There are some situations when you do not have to wear them. Face coverings on public transport information Staying close to home is one of the most important things we can do to reduce the risk of spreading the disease. Your local area means the area near your home that you regularly visit for essential services. What is considered “local” will differ depending on where you live. City dwellers may have a supermarket or dairy close by. If you live rurally, you may need to take a drive to reach these. You can exercise at parks or beaches within your region, but the closer to home the better. Be safe while out exercising. Keep 2 metres away from anybody not in your bubble. Make minimal trips. Most of all during this time, we encourage you to continue to connect with one another. Stay in touch with your older relatives and vulnerable people, talk to your friends, whānau and neighbours over the phone and see if they need your support. Acts of kindness and maintaining these connections is essential while we work to stop the spread of COVID-19. Last updated: 7 October 2020 Get support

All driver licences, warrants of fitness (WoFs), certificates of fitness (CoFs) and some vehicle certifications that expired on or after 1 January 2020 were extended until 10 October 2020. This recognised that during Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 3, through no fault of their own, many New Zealanders were unable to keep these documents up to date. This extension allowed vehicle users extra time to allow them to get up to date. As well as general hygiene guidance, there are some specific requirements while travelling in a taxi or ride-share. Please also follow any requests from the driver. Where possible, use hand sanitiser before and after you enter or exit a vehicle. When you get home, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. Physical distancing between the driver and passengers is important, even in smaller vehicles. If you're a passenger, sit in the rear passenger seats only — avoid sitting in the front passenger seat next to the driver. Sit as far as possible from the driver. If you’re the sole passenger, sit in the rear left-hand side passenger seat, diagonally opposite the driver. The maximum number of passengers is the number of passenger seats in the back of the vehicle. Most cars normally have 3 rear passenger seats. You’re encouraged to wear a face covering when you’re in a taxi or ride-share. Drivers of taxis and ride-sharing services in Auckland legally must wear a face covering.

Keep a record of your journey. You can use the Cook Strait ferries for recreation and tourism. Follow guidance to stay safe, track your journey and follow these tips: In the event of a COVID-19 resurgence, a regional Alert Level boundary could be put in place to ring-fence a certain area where there is a higher risk of transmission — for example to separate an area at Alert Level 3 from other areas at Alert Level 2, as in Auckland in August 2020. Movement across any Alert Level 3 boundary would be strictly limited to manage the risk of the virus spreading. Permissions to travel across any Alert Level 3 boundary fall into three categories: The Ministry of Health and MBIE have developed an online registration system that could be activated for both businesses and services, and personal, movement across an Alert Level boundary. The system would enable businesses and services to register before any Alert Level increase came into effect, and automatically generate standardised, verifiable documentation to support police enforcement and facilitate efficient movement through checkpoints. The system is ready to be activated in the event of an Alert Level 3 boundary, at which time more information will be published on the website of the approval agency: Last updated: 23 December 2020 Get support

Advice if you're in Auckland Advice if you're in Northland While we still can’t categorically rule these out as historical infections, test results so far indicate the two people may have contracted COVID-19 towards the end of their stay in managed isolation, after returning two negative tests each during their stay. It’s too early to early to make a firm conclusion. Genome sequencing results, which are expected tomorrow, and serology results expected the following day, will help develop the picture further. However, out of an abundance of caution we are now responding as if these are confirmed current infections. We understand that many will be anxious, but it’s important to remember we are carrying out these measures as a precaution. There is no evidence so far that suggests community transmission — but we need the right people to isolate and get tested. The two former returnees were initially classified as under investigation after returning positive tests and pending further investigation to determine if the infections were recent or historical. They returned a second positive test with a higher CT value which led to them being treated as confirmed cases. A third person in the family’s bubble has tested negative. The two family members who tested positive are in the process of being moved to Auckland’s quarantine facility. The two positive cases completed quarantine on 15 January and have been residing in North Auckland since. Further interviews are being carried out to determine the family’s detailed movements since they left managed isolation to identify close and casual contacts. The Ministry of Health website has a list of exposure events which include a location, date and time. View the locations of interest in Auckland (external link) People who have visited those locations during the time period, and as ever, anyone in Auckland with symptoms, are asked to: It’s important the right people isolate and get tested, so we don’t overwhelm testing centres.

A 43-year-old woman who absconded from a managed isolation facility in Auckland on Saturday evening is in police custody. The woman absconded from the Pullman Hotel on foot shortly before 6:20pm and was located soon after a couple of blocks away at 8pm on Anzac Avenue. This was excellent work by Police staff who located the woman as quickly as possible . She was located outdoors. The exact movements of the woman are still being determined. Charges are being considered by Police. The woman, who was travelling on her own, arrived in New Zealand from Brisbane, Australia, on 27 June. She had a COVID-19 test on 30 June which returned a negative result. We recognise that managed isolation can be stressful for people who come to it with a variety of circumstances. However, wilfully leaving our facilities cannot and will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will be taken. Every person who arrives in New Zealand must be isolated from other people for a minimum period of 14 days. They must also test negative for COVID-19 before they can go into the community. This 14-day period forms a critical part of the actions being taken to keep New Zealand and New Zealanders safe during a global pandemic when case numbers are constantly increasing overseas. Police are taking all necessary precautions to keep its staff safe. As such, the five Police officers who came into contact with the woman will self-isolate and undergo a COVID-19 test. Further advice will be provided to the officers around self-isolation and testing once we have clarified with certainty the movements and contact throughout the incident. Get support

A 32-year-old man will be charged after briefly absconding from a managed isolation facility in Auckland yesterday evening. The man has this morning tested positive for Covid-19 and has been moved to the Jet Park quarantine facility. Around 6:50pm the man escaped through a fenced area at the Stamford Plaza when he was out smoking, as a section of external fencing was being replaced. Security attempted to follow the man but were unsuccessful in locating him. Police were called immediately, and enquiries were underway to locate the man including reviewing CCTV footage and undertaking substantial area searches, before he returned to the facility where he was then interviewed by Police. Enquiries have established the man went to Countdown on Victoria Street West on foot and purchased items at a self-service checkout, before returning to the hotel around 8pm. Once the man’s movements were established Police visited the supermarket and ensured the self-service checkout and the areas entered by the man were cleaned. Auckland Regional Public Health is working with Countdown on any contact tracing and testing requirements. CCTV footage from within the supermarket has confirmed there was no close contact between the man and any staff or customers during his time there. Following the confirmation of the positive case, the supermarket has closed and a further deep clean is being carried out today. Police are currently undertaking an immediate review of CCTV footage to determine the man’s movements in the Auckland CBD. The actions of this man are completely unacceptable. Returnees are given clear instructions and information about what their responsibilities are. Managed isolation is a critical part in our defence against Covid-19, and it is up to each and every person entering this country to play their part. We take any breach of the Covid-19 rules very seriously. Wilfully leaving our facilities will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will be taken. The fencing in place at all managed isolation facilities is being replaced with 6ft high fences. Our security framework is currently being assessed to determine what improvements may need to be made, and security requirements are being re-emphasised at all facilities. We are also reviewing the arrangements in place for smokers, and security in smoking areas. The man, who is a New Zealand citizen and arrived from New Delhi on 3 July, will be summonsed to appear in court at a later date charged under section 26(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.

A man in his fifties is currently in Police custody after absconding from a Hamilton managed isolation facility, the Distinction Hotel, yesterday. He is due to appear in court later today. The person tested negative for their day 3 test and has today had their second test, after arriving from Sydney on 1 July. It is important to note that the COVID-19 health risk has been assessed as very low. Initial information suggests an individual cut through fence ties at the 1.8-metre fence to break out of the facility, and returned to the facility sometime after that. It is believed the individual was off the premises for around half an hour, between approximately 6:30pm and 7pm. Local health authorities and Police are in communication with local businesses that may have come into contact with the individual, and are exploring CCTV footage to confirm their movements. We have talked to one liquor store on Te Rapa Road where we believe the individual visited, and it has cleaned its premises as a result of our inquiries.  Police ensured no one entered the store this morning until health officials confirmed it was safe to do so. I would like to thank the store for their cooperation and for applying extra vigilance in this situation. Health officials have advised the store owner that all necessary steps have been taken to protect the public. Public health has provided advice to the store owner that this is a low-risk scenario and they do not have to close. A review of CCTV footage at the managed isolation facility has confirmed there are no close contacts. Investigations at this point also indicate there were no close contacts outside the facility. As we have said repeatedly - actions such as these are completely unacceptable. Returnees are given clear instructions and information about what their responsibilities are. Managed isolation is a critical part in our defence against COVID-19, and it is up to each and every person entering this country to play their part and abide by the law. The vast majority of returnees take their responsibilities seriously and abide by the law while in managed isolation. Since 26 March, 27,723 people have gone through managed isolation. We take any breach of the COVID-19 rules very seriously. Wilfully leaving our facilities will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will be taken.

Police are investigating an incident where a returnee in their late sixties absconded for a short period of time late last night from an Auckland managed isolation facility, the Waipuna Hotel. The individual tested negative for their day 3 test, after arriving in New Zealand on 4 July. Their next scheduled test is due on around day 12.  They are symptom free. Public Health advise the COVID-19 health risk has been assessed as very low. The individual is now under guard in the facility. Investigations at this point also indicate there were no close contacts outside the facility. Standard COVID-19 procedures are being followed for police and staff who were in contact with the individual. The individual broke and climbed out of a window in their room and climbed perimeter fencing to abscond. They were last seen at the facility at around 11pm. They were picked up by police at about 12.15am and immediately returned to the facility where they were put under guard. The individual had allegedly knocked on three residents’ doors while outside the facility. The first property did not answer. The second property called 111. At the third property the individual apparently spoke to a couple. Public health will be talking to local residents to reassure them of the low risk and provide any advice. The individual is being offered health and welfare support. Anyone who has concerns about their health should call Healthline on 0800 358 5453. Get support

Read more about pre-departure testing requirements: Pre-departure testing for arrivals into New Zealand Given the high rates of infection in many countries and evidence of the global spread of more transmissible variants, it’s clear that most global air routes will be of critical concern for the foreseeable future, and we must respond strongly to the evolving situation. New Zealand is currently in a very fortunate position with no community cases – let alone of new variant types – but we take nothing for granted. That’s why we continue to take action, with very specific steps to further strengthen our response at the air border. Amendments to our Air Border Order include: from 11.59pm on Friday 15 January, travellers arriving on all flights from the UK and US must have had a negative test result for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their departure the Director-General of Health is now formally authorised to and will soon expand the pre-departure test requirement to all countries and territories excluding Australia, Antarctica and some Pacific Islands. New Zealand already has some of the most stringent border protection measures in the world. Today’s amendments further strengthen that position in line with the Government’s overall elimination strategy. Today it was announced that passengers from any destination, excluding Australia, Antarctica and some Pacific Islands, will be required to undergo Day 0/1 testing upon arrival in New Zealand. This expands on measures already in place for passengers from the UK and US. It will be progressively introduced at Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities over three days, starting from Monday 18 January. Routine Day 3 and Day 12 tests will continue.  While these new requirements are designed to protect New Zealand, we understand they add to the complexity for people wanting to get here. If you are affected by these requirements, we want to provide as much support and information as possible ahead of your travels. RT-PCR tests, LAMP and viral antigen tests will all be accepted for pre-departure testing. All tests must be processed at a laboratory. A hard copy or electronic copy of the test result from an accredited laboratory will be acceptable documentation of a negative test. Upon arrival in New Zealand you will be required to produce proof of your negative test result to a Customs officer during your passport processing. Either a hard copy or an electronic copy will be accepted. Children under two years (24 months) will be exempt from pre-departure testing. In addition to previously announced medical exemptions, people who can present a medical certificate as a past recovered case of COVID-19 will also be exempt, if they are considered no longer infectious. Passengers transiting through the UK and US for not more than 96 hours before departing for New Zealand will be exempt for now from pre-departure testing. We have also decided that in rare cases, the requirement of a test 72 hours in advance may be extended to 96 hours if a person’s flight has been delayed or cancelled, or test results haven’t been received in time. In this situation, the flight must be rescheduled or rebooked to depart within 24 hours. It’s really important to remember that all travellers, including anyone exempted from the pre-departure testing requirement, will still be required to complete the 14 days mandatory isolation which applies to all new arrivals into New Zealand. MIQs are working hard to accommodate travellers that might be affected by the new testing requirements. Those travellers should work with airlines to rebook flights and contact MIQ for information about their booking. If New Zealanders overseas require consular assistance due to travel disruption, they should contact their nearest embassy or consulate. For more information, visit MIQ.govt.nz We’ll continue to communicate details around the new requirements via covid19.govt.nz and Unite Against COVID-19 social media, the SafeTravel website, and directly to airlines. Extensive consultation with airlines around implementation is ongoing. Under the Order, the primary obligation is on passengers to comply, but airlines are also expected to play a key role in checking documentation where practicable. From 29 January, arriving in New Zealand without evidence of a negative approved test or medical certificate would incur an infringement offence fee or a fine not exceeding $1,000.

An additional test for COVID-19 will be required for returnees from higher risk countries such as the United Kingdom on their arrival in New Zealand from midnight on 31 December, was announced today. The extra PCR test will be applied when returnees who’ve been in the United Kingdom or the United States during the preceding 14 days arrive at a managed isolation and quarantine facility. This new testing will be in addition to the current day three and day 12 tests. The returnees will also be required to be in isolation or quarantine in their allocated room at a facility until their initial test has returned a result. This means if the result is positive they will be transferred to a quarantine facility effectively several days earlier than under the standard two-test regime. The changes will be in force from midnight on 31 December. New Zealand has been monitoring overseas developments very closely, and, like many other countries, has heightened concerns about the new variants of the virus and their potential to spread more rapidly, and the ongoing high rates of infection in some countries. Asymptomatic people coming across the border are subsequently picked up in day three testing, so this will pick them up as early as possible. It will also help identify earlier anyone who sat close to them on flights. While growing travel restrictions are being imposed in countries that host airport hubs and by airlines themselves – which block routes to New Zealand for the overwhelming majority of travellers from higher risk countries – the New Zealand Government is taking this extra precautionary step to provide another layer of protection and to support our goal of making summer unstoppable. Our 14-day managed quarantine and isolation regime is providing one of the strongest border defences anywhere in the world. These additional requirements for returnees from higher risk countries will provide extra safety for people working in the facilities and greater assurance for New Zealand generally. Keeping the virus out remains our biggest protection and as we’ve done all along, we regularly review our settings and make changes where they will make a difference. Plans for pre-departure risk reduction measures, including testing for people leaving the United Kingdom for New Zealand, are currently being worked on, with a view to implementing them from mid-January. These include selecting the most effective forms of testing in the circumstances. Additional risk measures for other countries are also being considered. Returnees will still need to go through our 14-day managed isolation and quarantine process, on arrival in New Zealand. We’re aware this would present an extra hurdle for Kiwis planning to return and we’re not considering this lightly. We’re going beyond what we’ve done in the past, to stay ahead of what appears to be a worsening situation globally and, in doing so, we would reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading during transit and entering our managed isolation facilities. An eventual safe travel zone with Australia and Realm countries will ultimately mean fewer people from lower risk countries staying in our managed isolation facilities, thereby allowing more people from higher risk countries to arrive. Additional offshore risk measures including pre-departure testing would help us prepare for the increased risk such arrivals will bring to our facilities and to incoming flights.  The Ministry of Health has provided further information about the new testing requirements for those traveling from high risk countries. From 11:59pm on 31 December 2020 anyone arriving into New Zealand from the UK or USA will be required to: As now, if they are symptomatic on arrival they will go straight to a quarantine facility. We’ve been monitoring overseas developments very closely, and, like many other countries, have heightened concerns about the new variants of the virus and their potential to spread more rapidly. It is an extra precautionary step to provides another layer of protection for New Zealand from COVID-19. It will be the same PCR nasal swab that people currently receive but is in addition to the existing day 3 and day 12 tests. It usually takes 24-48 hours. People will be contacted directly if positive. They will be sent a text if negative. People will complete the remainder of their 14 days managed isolation as normal. They will be required to undertake a further test about day 3 of their stay and again about day 12 before they leave. If the result is positive the person will be transferred to a quarantine facility. This is several days earlier than previously would have been the case. The Government is preparing to require people travelling from the high risk locations to also have a pre-departure COVID-19 test. More details on this will be announced separately.

Our top priority continues to be the health, safety and wellbeing of all people in New Zealand. The need to carefully manage our borders is as critical now as at any time in the past nine months. We continue to learn more about the virus and adapt accordingly with stronger and more tailored border protections, depending on risk. Within our safety-first framework, we also have a responsibility to carefully balance our decisions, to support New Zealand’s economic recovery. This border exception delivers on a part of the recovery plan for international education. It underscores the Government’s commitment to the international education sector, which is important in the country’s long-term economic recovery from COVID-19. The students will return to New Zealand in phases, beginning with a cohort of 300 that will be able to return from April, with the remaining students returning throughout the year as MIQ availability allows. The return of these students will not affect the ability of Kiwis to return home and it is balanced against the requirement for skilled workers to enter the country. They will be subject to the same border rules and quarantine regime as all other arrivals – with any additional restrictions depending on where they come from. Returning students will need to book their space through the allocation system and will be billed the standard charges for managed isolation. They also need to be able to do more to support themselves in New Zealand, with the living expenses that are required for international students to be granted a visa now raised to $20,000 – up from $15,000. This system allows providers to welcome back students who have made the greatest commitment to New Zealand, and manage pressure on the MIQ system. The Government remains committed to working with the international education sector to ensure options for the broader return of international students continue to be considered, and that opportunities can be taken as and when it is safe and there is capacity to do so.

Following confirmation of the Cook Islands’ COVID-19 free status, and the implementation of strict health and border protocols, quarantine-free travel from the Cook Islands into New Zealand will resume. Cook Islanders will have quarantine-free entry to New Zealand to enable access to essential services, in the lead up to resuming free movement of people in both directions. This was a joint effort between the Cook Islands and New Zealand Governments to institute this safe travel corridor which will enable essential health, education, economic and social connections for the first time in many months for Cook Islanders. Both countries continue to take a very careful approach to managing our borders and preventing the spread of COVID-19 remains our paramount concern. As such strict protocols will be in place including pre-departure health requirements and separation from other travelers at Auckland International Airport. New Zealand and the Cook Islands are united in our commitment to protect our communities from COVID-19. Today’s announcement does not change the criteria for entry into the Cook Islands which is limited to Cook Islanders and current holders of Cook Islands work and residence permits who meet Cook Islands health entry requirements. These arrangements do not apply to New Zealanders wishing to travel to the Cook Islands. We said we would take a phased approach to resuming two-way travel and will do so only once all safety protocols can be met. Officials of both governments are committed to working towards ensuring all safety protocols and response capabilities are in place for the resumption of two-way quarantine free travel between the two countries within the first quarter of 2021.

After 102 days, we have our first cases of COVID-19 outside of a managed isolation or quarantine facility in New Zealand. Shortly I will ask Dr Bloomfield to set out the details of the cases involved. While we have all worked incredibly hard to prevent this scenario, we have also planned and prepared for it. We have a resurgence plan that we are now activating. Their plan is based on everything that we have learned as a country to date about COVID-19. It's also based on what we've seen from resurgence overseas. Both plans though are of course based on what we know about the cases in front of us. So, I will pass to Dr Bloomfield who will set out those details, then I will share with you the decisions that have been made and response through meetings with officials and also after ministers convened this evening and set out what it will mean for everyone. First, Dr Bloomfield. Thank you Prime Minister. Kia ora. So, as the PM has said, we actually have four confirmed cases of COVID-19 in one family acquired from an unknown source. The first case to present was a person in their 50s who lives in South Auckland. That person was swabbed yesterday when they presented to their general practitioner with symptoms. That test was processed twice and returned positive, and a second swab today also returned a positive result. Importantly the person has no history of overseas travel, and as per our usual protocol, we worked very closely with Auckland Regional Public Health to interview the person. We've sprung into action, and in fact all those family members residing in the same household - there were another six - were all tested, and three of the six have returned positive test results. The other three were negative. Other close contacts from workplaces have already been contacted and put into self-isolation and are being tested whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. All close contacts remain in self-isolation for 14 days regardless of their test result, while casual contacts go into self-isolation and can only leave self-isolation once they return a negative test. In addition, we are working over the next few days to test all people working at our borders and in our managed isolation facilities to help us trace the possible origin of this case where we don't currently know the source. Now, there are no barriers to anyone who has cold or flu like symptoms getting tested. Testing is free, and as I have said previously, and it's even more relevant now, if you are offered a test, please take it. In Auckland, the four community testing centres are Northcote, Grafton, Henderson and Wiri will be operating with more staff and for longer hours over coming days. The testing centres that are in Auckland and the Waitemata and Counties Manukau DHBs are already preparing to receive more people and there will be further details on the Ministry website tonight. Those DHBs are also planning pop-up clinics over coming days and they will publicise locations and hours of these clinics. We will work closely with DHBs and primary care around the country to ensure additional testing capacity is available to meet the expected increase in demand from people with symptoms. And I strongly encourage any New Zealander with symptoms whether in the Auckland region or outside it to please be tested. We have been saying for some weeks it was inevitable that New Zealand would get another case of community transmission. This is a tricky virus. We have been working on the basis that it could be at any time and been preparing for that time. That time is now. The health system is well prepared and the important thing now is that we stop the spread of the virus in our community. As we did in the early days of the virus emerging, we need to stamp it out. There are things that every single New Zealander now needs to do. We have done these before. Continue or get back to stringent hand hygiene - washing for 20 seconds with soap and water or regular use of an alcohol-based hand gel. Sneeze and cough into your elbow. If you or a family member are unwell wherever you live in New Zealand, stay at home and seek advice from your GP or Healthline about getting a test. Practice physical distancing of two metres wherever possible, and most recently our advice around the use of masks which has been updated. Please consider wearing a mask in spaces or places where it is hard to physically distance. If you have any concerns, please seek advice from Healthline or your GP. If you have not already, please take this opportunity to download the NZ COVID Tracer app. It will be an essential tool in helping us contact you if we need to as part of our follow up on this case. And finally, our contact tracing team will of course be in contact with anyone who may be identified as a contact, whether casual or close of this case. Please be responsive if you are contacted, return the call and assist our efforts to rapidly identify and isolate and test any possible cases. The case is a wakeup call against any complacency that may have set in. We cannot afford to let this virus spread. We are working to not let it happen here, that what has happened in other places they have seen resurgences like this. We have done this before and we can and will do it again. Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you. As you will have heard from Dr Bloomfield, we have four cases all in one household. More than one place however is involved. Contact tracing is underway but currently we know that of those workplaces it means that we are not talking about one distinct suburb in Auckland who may likely have been affected by those who have tested positive. You also have heard that our first cases still leave questions to be answered. The most important of which is tracing this case back to its original origin. The reason that is important is because when we're more able to do that we can be much more certain about tracing and isolating all close contacts. When we can't do that, it means we have to take a precautionary approach. At this stage, we have not yet been able to determine the source of these cases. There is no immediate link that we have found as yet to a managed isolation facility that we are aware of, and there is no yet known connection to any high-risk individuals such as those who work at our border. Therefore, we need to take a much more precautionary approach until we can find the source of this case and make sure that we reduce the risk of wider spread. One of the most important lessons we've learned from overseas is the need to go hard and go early and stamp out flare ups to avoid the risk of wider outbreak. As disruptive as it is, a strong and rapid health response remains the best long-term economic response. In line with our precautionary approach, we will be asking Aucklanders to take swift action with us. As of 12 noon tomorrow, Wednesday 12 August, we will be moving Auckland to Level 3 restrictions for a period of three days until midnight on Friday. These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions on how to respond to it once we have further information. Let me set out what that means for Aucklanders and the rest of New Zealand. We are asking people in Auckland to stay home to stop the spread. This means doing the simple things that you will already be familiar with to prevent picking up the virus or passing it onto others. First, act as if you have COVID and as if the people around you have COVID. At Level 3, you are asked to stay at home in your bubble other than for essential movements such as going to the supermarket or local recreation. If you are in Auckland, you must work from home unless you are an essential service worker. All schools and childcare facilities in Auckland are closed as of tomorrow morning except for the children of essential service workers. And those who are involved will remember that at Level 3 we allow you to access schools and early childhood for Level 3 for essential service workers only. All public facilities; bars, restaurants, and businesses must close by midday tomorrow. Gatherings of more than ten people in Auckland again will be restricted and are restricted again for funerals, tangihanga and wedding services only. And the rest of the country gatherings of course though, I'll outline in further detail momentarily. Travelling into Auckland is prohibited unless you normally reside there and are travelling home. If you are currently in Auckland but do not normally reside there you also can leave to go home. But we are asking you to be very conscious of your health and if you begin to display any symptoms please get tested. We are defining the area covered as Auckland and covered by Level 3 restrictions as the geographic boundary of the Auckland Super City which extends from Wellsford in the north to Pukekohe in the south. Police will be issuing further guidance on parameters including road block use first thing in the morning. As you will recall all key services; supermarkets, pharmacies, medical centres, they do remain open. So food and supplies will continue to be readily available. Food delivery is also available as you recall at Level 3. Please do not rush to the supermarket tonight, you'll recall as when we were in Level 3 on our last occasion supermarkets will be open, there will be ample stock on the shelves. There is no reason to go out and make any purchases this evening. If you operated as an essential service under Level 4 and Level 3 last time, then those are the settings we revert to at Level 3 again. If in doubt stay at home tomorrow until you have clarity from your employer. That then brings me to the rest of New Zealand. We will be moving the rest of the country outside of Auckland to Level 2. This will come into place from midday tomorrow and run through until midnight on Friday, so the same period of time that we are applying restrictions for Auckland. That means social distancing applies and mass gatherings in that time will need to be need to be limited to 100 people. And of course all of the other guidance you will be used to from Level 2 applies again as well. I know that this information will be very difficult to receive. We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again. But we had also prepared for it and as a team we have also been here before. We know if we have a plan and stick to it we can work our way through very difficult and unknown situations. Before I finish I want to talk briefly about some of the additional plans that we have in place. As the Director General has set out, Auckland Regional Health will be standing up a mass testing programme across the region where we will seek to test tens of thousands of people over the coming days in order to understand any potential unidentified cases in the community. It's our intention to test everyone who works at the border and everyone who works in managed isolation facilities with a focus on Auckland. We will also be undertaking wide testing of those who are symptomatic in Auckland. Please so I ask you don't visit your GP or a community testing station if you are perfectly well. We are seeking to test those who are symptomatic and those who are working in those high risk areas. More details of the location of these setbacks and guidance on who should get a test we will be providing again in the morning. A final word on mask use. We now know that these can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID. If you are in Auckland we ask that you use a mask when you are accessing essential services. For the rest of the country we advise their use if you're in a place with social distancing is difficult, so for instance public transport. Let me finish by saying this: while this initial three-day lockdown will mainly affect the Auckland region, I am asking the team of 5 million to stand really again as well. Together we've beaten the virus before and with fast action and by acting together we can do so again. We have come too far to go backwards. I am asking New Zealanders to once again be strong and be kind. If you know someone in Auckland, give them a call, reach out, check that they're okay. If you're in Auckland, please make sure that your neighbours are okay, ensure they are looked after and that they have the supplies and the support they need. We know what to do. We know what to do because we've successfully done it before. Please stay home if you're in Auckland. Be vigilant. We will get through this. We're happy to take questions. Media: [Indistinct] over the next four days is it likely that those Level 3 restrictions will be extended until you find the source? PM Jacinda Ardern: Of course it is about gathering as much information as possible in the next three days and we won't just do that through contact tracing. We will also do that through wide testing, not only of those obviously working in those high risk areas - and that's why we intend to test everyone at the border - but also in our managed isolation facilities and those symptomatic. If we are unable to identify the source, what we should identify is whether or not we have wider geographic spread and whether or not we have a number of cases beyond the family that has been identified here. Dr Bloomfield? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I think you've summarised it well Prime Minister. There are two things we want to do and we will be working a pace to do over the next three days. The first is to identify the extent of this outbreak and control it. The second is to identify the source. Media: [Inaudible question] PM Jacinda Ardern: Well I'll leave that to Dr Bloomfield who has the information. Of course those workplaces that are affected are being contacted. But I think the important point I wanted to make is that it would not have been possible to successfully isolate one small part of Auckland from the interviews that are being undertaken, a precautionary approach does point to us needing unfortunately to ask all of Auckland to take a precautionary approach with us. Media: And none of those workplaces had any connection to the border or travel in any way? PM Jacinda Ardern: Not that we've identified but of course those original- those interviews have been undertaken with the family and the original case as we speak. And then from there moving into the wider workplaces and interviewing others. But Dr Bloomfield… Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Two things to say there and I don't have the detail of the workplaces with me but the two workplaces in question, immediate action has been taken to identify close contacts, isolate those people and in fact shut down one of the workplaces so that further wide testing can happen. Media: Are they customer facing? Are they workplaces where you would see a lot people coming out? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Just based on the conversations I've had, no they are not. Neither of them are. PM Jacinda Ardern: I'll just come here. Media: What about people who have recently been to Auckland such as yourself. PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. And that's where we're asking people to be very mindful of their own health and wellbeing. We're asking that if they feel unwell, immediately isolate, seek advice and seek a test if that's the advice you receive. But at this stage that's the extent of the advice for those who have recently been in Auckland. Media: What about yourself, you're still obviously on the campaign trail hitting up lots of different parts of the country, are you going to change your plans because of this? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes, I will. I anticipate that over at least the next three days I'll likely be based here in Wellington. Media: {Indistinct] Longer than three days though won't it? PM Jacinda Ardern: I'm not going to speculate at this stage. We've set out a plan that should give us much more information in order to base further decisions. The view was move quickly with a precautionary approach, with the hope of course that we can ascertain that information, that we'll be able to limit the effect on other New Zealanders as much as possible. The alternative is to wait. That runs the risk, if we do have a wider number of individuals affected, of the spread continuing to escalate. Media: Why did it take so long for you to tell the public? PM Jacinda Ardern: So I was advised at 4 o'clock this afternoon whilst I was in the van travelling directly here to Wellington. In that time, additional interviewing took place of those individuals to see if we could ascertain the connection to any high risk areas such as borders or MIQ because that may have given us the option of isolating and contact tracing. We haven't been able to ascertain those connections. Also that gave a chance for ministers with power to act to be convened, to make sure that the orders that need to be in place were able to be drafted and just to ensure that all of the information we needed to provide the public. We have moved though very, very quickly as you can see from the amount that's happened in that space of time. Media: [Inaudible] PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes, sorry, Derek(*)? Media: If all Aucklanders are supposed to stay at home, does that mean no movement in and out of the super city as well? PM Jacinda Ardern: Correct. We're asking those that are- only, those who are returning home to enter into Auckland, and only those who are leaving to go home to exit Auckland. Those who reside there, we are asking to stay there. The whole point of this precautionary approach is to try and isolate any potential spread outside of that region and to other areas. Media: How likely is it that these four cases are self-contained, or can the public expect that we might see more cases in the coming days? PM Jacinda Ardern: Given we haven't - and I'll let Dr Bloomfield - given we haven't yet identified the original source case; I'd say it is likely we will see other cases as we start tracing that. Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Yes, we're expecting to see other cases. And as was the situation earlier in the year; we want to find all those other cases as soon as possible and isolate- identify and isolate any contacts. Hence the work that is going in, and has been going in since 3 o'clock today to ramp up the capacity and capability for testing - both this evening, including at urgent care centres across Auckland, but also in the morning. And there will be pop up clinics as well as longer hours and more extensive testing at those existing clinics. Media: [Inaudible] PM Jacinda Ardern: Henry(*)? Yep. Media: Given the low Level of surveillance testing and given the fact that this case is not immediately [indistinct] the border, can we be sure that COVID ever really was stamped out or is there a possibility that this has been somewhere in Auckland since March? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: I think if you reflect back to that period of time when we were coming down through Level 3 and 2, we did extensive testing right across the country, and we- including a broad ethnicity spread as well. So, yes, I think we can be confident. And the fact that we've gone over 100 days, again, I think lends- if you look at the number of tests that have been done and the geographical and ethnicity spread of those tests, I think we can be very confident. So, this is- but this is why we have continued that community surveillance testing of symptomatic people, and it shows that it was the right thing to do. And now we've got, you know, we've also got a clear plan in place about what to do. PM Jacinda Ardern: Keeping in mind, that even if you've got undetected cases in your community, very unfortunately, at some point one will elevate and escalate into your hospital system. We have not seen that, but that's the other indicator if you've got undetected transmission in your community, and we have not seen that. Clare(*)? Media: Realistically, if you are expecting more cases to come up, the decision at the end of the three days will be whether or not there is another 2 weeks or so at Level 3 for Auckland, or a move to Level 4 if there are more cases? PM Jacinda Ardern: I, again, I don't wish to predetermine that at this point. If, for instance, there's a scenario where we're able to rapidly identify the source case, we have confidence of our Level of isolation and contact tracing of all close contacts around that case. That is a potential scenario, but again, that is why we're giving ourselves that 72 hours to do that large scale rapid testing, isolation, and contact tracing. And we will be updating everyone on Friday about what our expectations are of the next step. In the meantime, daily updates will give people a sense of the progress that's being made, and the information we're able to gather. Media: Dr Bloomfield, are you comfortable with that 72 hours or did you advise the Government that it should, in fact, be longer than that? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: In fact, there was very quick and unanimous agreement amongst officials, and also in our discussions with our colleagues in Auckland, that the three days would give us a good amount of time to do quite extensive testing and the contact tracing - which is already well underway - to identify any possible close contacts and casual contacts, have them tested. And so, the three days is a good amount of time for us to be able to get good information about the extent of the outbreak, and whether it is contained. And also, the link back to where that case might have come from. PM Jacinda Ardern: Just keeping in mind, these are very significant decisions; moving an entire city, and New Zealand's largest city, into Level 3 restrictions is not a decision we take lightly. We need to make sure we have as much information as possible, and so this- and this move means that we can be cautious but also make sure that we have more information before we make any decisions that have a longer term impact. We also are mindful that if we make decisions that have a longer term impact, at that point we need to be talking about other financial supports and so on that would be necessary. This gives us a window to have a good assessment over what it is that has emerged today. Media: And on the logistics of Level 3 again, last time there were butchers and greengrocers - that sort of came into controversy - are we looking at them being closed, or this time will they allowed to be open? PM Jacinda Ardern: We've kept the same restrictions that you will recall from Level 3, are in place again at Level 3. So, do keep in mind that that actually allows takeaways and services that weren't able to be in place at Level 4. Media: Can you tell us a little bit more about the cases, what are the ages of the confirmed cases? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: At this point I would rather do that tomorrow, because I would like to get- have a discussion with the family- have had a discussion with the family. Yes, there are, I can say, that the ages do include one child. What I would say is that the child that is a case is a pre-schooler who does not attend in early childhood education facility. Media: What symptoms are the cases showing, are they quite severe symptoms or? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: So, the person who presented as the first case did have a fever, a cough, and, you know, so quite noticeable symptoms. And the partner of that person also had obvious symptoms also, in fact, that preceded that of the case that we diagnosed first. Media: How long had they been experiencing those symptoms? Is there a risk that they'd been out and about and had spread it; they could have been the spreaders? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Yes, it was about a four to five-day period from the symptom onset to when the test was done. So again, that's one reason we are following up all possible close contacts. And in fact, what we have found so far is that there is a relatively small number of close contacts, both in the workplace and outside of the workplace. Media: [Indistinct] where are the workplaces? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: At this point, the only information I'd like to share is that they are from South Auckland, and that the workplaces are beyond South Auckland, so they're and other parts of Auckland… Because that's what the- request of the family at this point. PM Jacinda Ardern: So, we'll look to provide more information in the morning. It's just a matter of making sure that when we do so, we're not in a situation of identifying directly individuals, because there are a small number of people involved in some of those workplaces which would make them identifiable. Obviously, the fact we're taking this precautionary approach means that we are ensuring the health and safety of everyone in Auckland by taking this precautionary approach. Those who are directly involved with the workplaces of these individuals have already and are already being contacted directly to make sure that they have that extra requirement to be in self-isolation and to be tested. But again, we will look to provide more information in the morning - I know this will be an area of interest. Media: If you've been in Auckland the last few days and you've flown back to your home elsewhere in New Zealand, should you be working from home for the moment? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yeah. And so, this is where we are asking people to be- take a precautionary approach, we do want them to monitor their symptoms, we do want people to be cautious. And we are asking everyone outside of Auckland to socially distance, and so that is part of the requirements that we're asking of people. And people will engage their common sense in this as well. Yep? Media: You- obviously rest homes are where the most vulnerable are- PM Jacinda Ardern: [Interrupts] Yes, I'll ask Dr Bloomfield to speak to rest homes. Media: Are you looking at maybe locking down rest homes? That's where all the deaths kind of popped up in New Zealand, how are you going to protect the vulnerable? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Yeah, so earlier in the year when the outbreak started to gather pace, before we even went into an Alert Level 3 or 4 situation, we had advised aged residential care facilities - and many of them had already - we had- we'd advised them to stop all visits. Our advice to aged residential care, countrywide at the moment, is to also stop visits for the time being, certainly over these next few days, because we want to take a very precautionary approach with that setting. Media: [Indistinct…] in aged residential care facilities? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Not at this point, recalling that there is already a protocol in place where all those reporting for- who work in aged residential care do have symptom checks before they start work. And obviously, part of the shutting down visitors will be making sure that those facilities are enforcing that and making sure it's routinely done. Media: If that's the most vulnerable place, why wouldn't you be testing? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Because there's no indication yet that we should test there, the important first action is to close all visiting to those rest homes, and then we will take it from there. Again, this is this first few days, the actions we are taking immediately are in Auckland - as outlined by the Prime Minister - and anyone symptomatic, including those who work in or who stay in aged residential care facilities, should be tested. Media: [Indistinct] one of the things that happened during Level 2 and Level 3 last time was elderly were asked to stay home. Under Level 2 of the rest of New Zealand, are you asking- PM Jacinda Ardern: At the moment we are asking everyone outside of Auckland to apply the Level 2 restrictions, so that is as it stands and obviously in Auckland we're asking everyone to stay at home. Media: Two different Level 2's but over-70- PM Jacinda Ardern: [Interrupts] As we- you'll remember as we came down, at Level 2 we weren't asking at that point every single person to stay home. But again Level 2 - social distancing, good hand washing regimes, making sure you are not leaving your home if you are unwell, and we're asking if you're in public places that are- that it's a little harder to socially distance, for people to wear a mask. In Auckland, Level 3. Media: [Indistinct] the gentleman who tested positive for COVID-19 in South Korea recently, he also resided in South Auckland by memory. Are you concerned that these two situations could be linked? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: We're not. And we've been through a very thorough process with that person who was- who tested positive on arrival in South Korea and very much concluded that everything about that situation suggests that it was a positive test of someone who had had earlier infections some months before. PM Jacinda Ardern: Keeping in mind that there was also roughly 100 close contacts around that person all tested, all tested negative. And of course the evidence suggesting that, from the swab, that it was an old infection. Media: As the testing goes on, within how many days do you expect to see- could we, for example, see tomorrow some of those close, close contacts coming back and testing positive or negative? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. The turnaround can be, it can be very quick. Obviously we've already turned around from the time that there was a positive test in the family, we've already turned around testing in the wider family already to identify those other positives. So, we can turn it around very quickly. Down the back. Media: Do you have concerns for wider contact tracing? Given that there's been quite a slow uptake on using the app? PM Jacinda Ardern: I'll let Dr Bloomfield speak to that, but already we have good information that's already being actioned. Dr Ashley Bloomfield: So, two comments there. First of all, the really significant information development over the last few months has been our, in our national contact tracing solution which all our public health units are on. And just to give you an example of the value of that - tonight, as the public health unit in Auckland was interviewing the person, and the information was being entered into the system there, we could view it nationally, and in fact then it's visible to us nationally and indeed to other public health units if they need it. So that's the that's the most significant and really valuable asset we have for our contact tracing, as well as the fact we have upped the capacity in our public health units across the country to be able to trace up to 350 cases per day - and we have additional capacity nationally. The app itself, even if- so I'm encouraging people to download it even if you don't use it, and I encourage people to use it just by registering and giving us your up to date contact information - that's significantly useful. So please, go ahead and do that if you haven't already. PM Jacinda Ardern: Dr Bloomfield, this is a very good reminder of why everyone needs to use the app. Please - COVID Tracer - the Ministry of Health have made that app available, download it, use it. We'll be asking businesses again to put in place those QR codes. This is a vital and useful tool for us. If you don't use a phone that has that technology, please keep a diary of all places you've been. Sam(*). Media: Has the app been used in this particular case though? Have you issued an exposure notification yet? Or are you planning to do so? Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Not yet, no. And we're not planning to at the moment, it depends on the extent of whether we have to send a message out to- more widely but because we're taking quite significant action here in Auckland, and as the Prime Minister as outlined, then we don't need to send out the notifications. PM Jacinda Ardern: But also of course continuing to undertake all of that contact tracing around that family as we speak. Media: Would it be helpful for Aucklanders? Or indeed all New Zealanders who think back over the last two weeks that about who they came in contact with and where they were? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. Yes, absolutely. It's always the exercise we ask, that would be a useful exercise for anyone, particularly in Auckland, when you're at home over the next three days just sitting down, thinking about the places you've been over the last two weeks, reminding yourself and keeping a log. But just making sure that you're, again getting into that practice of doing that at all times. The app is there to make it easier for you but it is not the only way you can record your movements. Media: A lot of Aucklanders and New Zealanders will be having this sinking feeling in their stomach at the moment. What's your message to them? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. I absolutely understand, and that is a completely natural feeling. We've had 102 days, and it was very easy to feel perhaps like New Zealand was out of the woods. But of all the countries in the world we have gone the longest, no country has gone as far as we did without having resurgence. And so because we were the only ones, that meant that we always knew we had to plan, and we have planned, and now that moment has arrived where we need to utilise that plan. So my request is not to be dispirited or disheartened. Well, we've rolled out our plans before - it has worked. so I'm asking that everyone joins us on that journey again, reminds themselves of what we had to do last time, and just continues to stay with us as we keep sharing all the information we have as we try and get back control again of these cases that we've identified. Again, this is something we have prepared for. Media: [Indistinct] out of Auckland avoid inter regional travel. If they have flights already, say Dunedin to Christchurch, should they cancel them? PM Jacinda Ardern: So again, we're keeping the rest of the country at Level 2 at this stage and so, of course, that means- you'll recall at Level 2 we allowed inter regional travel. But we're asking no one to go into Auckland unless they're returning home, and only those who are leaving to go home to exit out of Auckland. If you're an Aucklander and you have a home elsewhere, please stay in Auckland - that is our request of you. We're asking people to apply the same common sense that we used before. When it comes to people who've been in Auckland, I'm going to get a bit more advice around that. At this stage we are saying, people go home, keep an eye on your wellness. But I will get a little bit more advice about what we do for those who have come out of Auckland, just to make sure we are consistent. But you can go home if you're in Auckland and that's not where you live. Media: For people who have been in Auckland recently, they don't have to [indistinct]? PM Jacinda Ardern: Sorry? Media: So people who have been in Auckland recently, for now they don't [indistinct]…? PM Jacinda Ardern: [Talks over] I will get some further advice on that. At this stage though we're saying, do go home if you're in Auckland, do go home, use your common sense. Keep in mind we have just put that region into a Level 3 restricted area. Make sure that you are keeping an eye on your health and wellbeing. I'll give another update on our expectations on that group tomorrow. What I'll also do because we've also, as discussed rest homes, I will be asking Minister Jenny Salesa to engage with those facilities again as we have in the past - make sure that we are taking a precautionary approach there. Those are some of our highest risk areas. Minister- Dr Bloomfield's already set out our expectations there, but I want to make sure it's as rigorous as possible because it is an area where we know there is huge vulnerability. Media: [Indistinct] if your family is self-isolating it at home? And if so, if you've considered moving them to a quarantine facility? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. We are discussing with them a possible move to, to a quarantine facility. Media: Separated from the [indistinct]? PM Jacinda Ardern: [Talks over] Yes. Now they are, they are as a family, they are as a family - they've only just received their results and we're discussing with them movement into quarantine. Media: [Inaudible question]. PM Jacinda Ardern: At the moment public health staff are with them. Media: People are already streaming into supermarkets in Auckland after this announcement. Are you worried about that? PM Jacinda Ardern: Again, I can only reiterate what I said in the beginning. I absolutely understand it's a completely natural reaction, it happens around public holidays as well when people know that there are closures - but there are no closures here. We've all experienced before that the supermarkets will not shut, they will remain open, people will continue to be able to access them. So there is no need for anyone to go out now and stock up - they'll be open tomorrow, they'll be open the next day, they'll be open right the way through. Media: We're getting calls that it's already happening. [Indistinct]. PM Jacinda Ardern: Look I know - that's just been shared with me. And again, I can only reiterate as I have - there is no need. They are an essential service, so are pharmacies - diaries will remain open as well. It's just as people will recall when we were in Level 3 last time - you'll even be able to get a takeaway coffee with distance. So all of those things remain in place. Media: [Indistinct] sold out Blues v Crusaders match planned for Saturday at Eden Park. What's the message to people [indistinct]? PM Jacinda Ardern: I expect that our Minister for Sport will engage with them directly. At the moment though we're keeping these restrictions till midnight Friday. I understand that that creates uncertainty for some of those major fixtures, so we'll be in dialogue with them. But at the moment we're keeping it at midnight Friday, with updates as we go. Media: [Indistinct] explain what happens after mid- sorry, I know it's hard to predict the future, but if you manage to determine there's no community transmission, find the source of this, will we move straight down- back down into Level 1? Or will you bring down the Levels as you did? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yeah, we've always tended to take a precautionary approach, we'll make that assessment at the time. But I imagine that we will be on guard having found these cases in our community at this point. You won't have to necessarily wait till Friday to get a sense of the progress we're making, or not. We will continue to give updates and I expect that we're looking at another press conference at this point mid-morning tomorrow. We will be making sure that Commissioner Andrew Coster is available to give further information around some of the ways that the roadblocks and checks will be operating. And of course, we'll be making sure that there's information available for morning media as well. Media: [Indistinct] any events in Auckland this weekend? PM Jacinda Ardern: Look, that- I haven't ruled that out. But again, we do need to take a cautious approach as we have with this decision today. Media: During Victoria's second wave they- a lot of people there became really frustrated having to go through this process again - we saw hundreds of people getting fines for example. Are you concerned that New Zealanders, particularly Aucklanders, will either become complacent? Or just frustrated and break the rules? PM Jacinda Ardern: Do you know, I've, I've always of course known that we are our own people, our own country, we've taken our own approach to COVID, so I'm not going to make an assumption about what will happen to here in New Zealand based on what's happened in Australia because we've always done things our own way. We know that by following the guidelines that we've set and the Alert Levels that we put in place originally, that it worked. No country in the world was free of community transmission as long as New Zealand has been. Now, we also know that other countries have had resurgence and have got them back under control, so we're asking for every New Zealanders help in doing that. If we get this right we can limit the effect on the rest of New Zealand, but we'll only be able to do that if we do follow these rules as we did in the first place. Media: How strictly, how strictly will these rules be enforced? PM Jacinda Ardern: In the same way that we have before. So, nothing has changed in that regard - the orders will be in place, we are asking people to comply with them and we're doing that for a 72-hour period. Media: [Indistinct] incubation period, and previously testing didn't really come through- like cases didn't really come through in testing for like 10 days. Is it likely that we will need to be Level 3- Auckland will need to be at Level 3 for at least two weeks? Is that- can people- should people expect that? PM Jacinda Ardern: Again as I've said, we'll make sure that everyone's well aware of the decisions that need to be made once we have more information. But it is a very big decision to shut down an entire city for a two-week period without having full information around the source of this case. And so, I feel very strongly that we need to give ourselves the ability to answer those questions before we ask that of all of Auckland. I believe we should have much more information over the next 72 hours, we're going to undertake widespread mass testing, continue the interviews across the range of those individuals affected and see if we can identify those sources which may then limit our need to continue with these restrictions for long periods of time. Media: [Indistinct] scenario, very widespread testing and no, no positive results at all. Given the incubation period, surely a precautionary approach would require Level 3 to be longer? PM Jacinda Ardern: Of course. Rather than working through hypotheticals I'd much rather work through the evidence that we have, and we're likely to be able to gather much, much more information over the next 24, 48, 36 hours. Media: Prime Minister, lots of people, including the Leader of the National Party, have said that there's a conspiracy theory going on and that with all this talk about Alert Level 2 coming in that the government knew more than it sharing. Was that what's happened here? Can you put to bed any of those rumours? PM Jacinda Ardern: I've already shared with you the timeline of when I was first informed, I'll let Dr Bloomfield speak to his own knowledge. I was informed of this case after exiting a gathering, a public gathering in Wanganui which would have roughly being 4pm today. I drove directly to Wellington. Dr Bloomfield. Dr Ashley Bloomfield: Yes. So I was informed via text, an urgent text from the Chief Executive of Counties Manukau DHB in Auckland just before 3:00, and we were on a Zoom call with a number of people within about five minutes, and standing up the response very quickly and letting people know exactly what was happening. But that's the first indication we had that a test result came through with the- a test that was done of a symptomatic person yesterday in general practice, and it just reiterates why we were doing that testing and that we had a plan really to spring into action as soon as we got a result [indistinct]. Media: [Indistinct] Judith calls today. And have you got- PM Jacinda Ardern: Sorry. Media: Have you talked to Judith Collins today? PM Jacinda Ardern: Yes. Media: And are you getting any advice on postponing the election? PM Jacinda Ardern: So, I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition I'd say approximately, approximately 8:30 this evening to advise her, that was immediately after I came off the call advising and discussing with Ministers our course of action. I then immediately spoke to the Mayor of Auckland and to the Leader of the Opposition. I advised her of the information we had about the case, the proposed course of action and response and what we would be undertaking in the next period of time as well to ascertain further information. As for your second, the second question around impact on the election - at this point my absolute focus is our immediate response to these cases. I have not given any consideration to any impact on the election at this stage - that's likely something that, if needs be, we would report on further down the track. but certainly not at this stage. Media: Do you expect all political parties to put campaigning on hold though? PM Jacinda Ardern: Well, ultimately I'm expecting them to do the same thing we're asking of every New Zealander at this time for the next period until midnight on Friday. If they are resident in Auckland to stay home, obviously to comply with Level 2 restrictions for the rest of the country - I absolutely understand the impact that will have. I too obviously will be changing plan, and over the next three days expect that everything I had planned will be will be put to the wayside. Media: Isn't it a realistic prospect that we could see the election delayed? PM Jacinda Ardern: That's not- I don't want to speculate on that at this point. Obviously the Electoral Commission have always undertaken planning to allow an election at Alert Level 2. But again, anything beyond that right now for something that's six weeks away I would be purely speculative. Media: Tomorrow, parliament's dissolving tomorrow... PM Jacinda Ardern: [Interrupts] I'll take the last, last few questions? Media: Is it appropriate to dissolve parliament tomorrow? Which essentially leaves New Zealand with no democratic accountability for the government, as we going into what could be an extended State of Emergency? PM Jacinda Ardern: So, keeping in mind of course - but that does still, that does not diminish or remove the ability of Cabinet to continue to make decisions - I intend to act in the exact same way I would if we were in a parliamentary recess for instance. I will continue to maintain contact with the Leader of the Opposition - I've already indicated to her that I will do that, I intend to give her another update tomorrow once we have further information and further details of the work that we'll be doing over the next three days. So in that sense, the dissolution of parliament will actually not change the way I intend to behave with the Leader of the Opposition. Okay. Thank you everyone. We'll see you in the morning.

Medicines regulator Medsafe will seek advice and recommendations from the Medicines Assessment Advisory Committee (MAAC) next Tuesday, about the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. The Ministerial expert advisory committee will review Medsafe’s benefit-risk assessment of the pharmaceutical company’s data and, depending on feedback, Medsafe may be able to grant provisional approval as soon as the following day. Medsafe’s process not only ensures New Zealanders can feel confident in the vaccines we receive, it’s also been timely and means we will be ready to receive and administer vaccines as soon as Pfizer is in a position to send them. If granted, the provisional approval will mean that Medsafe has sufficient information and assurance of both safety and effectiveness for it to allow vaccination to start – though there will be continued monitoring of the vaccine here and overseas. However, if Medsafe decides next week that some additional assurances are required before it grants approval, they are making the right decision on behalf of all New Zealanders. It’s vital for New Zealanders to know that Medsafe is undertaking robust assessments of this vaccine and others so that we can be confident they’re safe and effective. It streamlined its approval processes for faster access, but it hasn’t cut any corners along the way. Safety is paramount and we want to be assured of this and also allow all New Zealanders the same opportunity of protection as other countries. We’ve always known a safe and effective vaccine is a vital part of our COVID-19 response for our long-term control of the virus. 2021 is Year of the Vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines will play a critical role in protecting New Zealanders’ health and wellbeing and, over time, will be a big step back to normality. The first focus will be vaccinating our border and managed isolation and quarantine workforce and their close contacts. Once the vaccine arrives in New Zealand, we expect to be able to complete vaccinating this group within two to three weeks. Our frontline staff have been protecting our country from this global pandemic during the past year and protecting them and those who share their households is a priority. That will be the start of New Zealand’s largest ever vaccination campaign. And that will take some time and the most important thing is when we finish not when we start. However we do intend to get our front line staff vaccinated as soon as possible. Doing so will add another layer to our border defences. We hope to start vaccinating the wider population mid-year.

The Government has confirmed a community-wide trial of CovidCard technology in Rotorua as it explores options for COVID-19 contact tracing. The University of Otago and Nelson Marlborough district health board (DHB) ran a government-funded trial of the CovidCard during lockdown, which found the CovidCard works under controlled conditions. A further trial will be run in Rotorua region, which will involve between 250 and 300 people. It will help us understand how the CovidCard works in a real-world scenario, if it works with our existing contact tracing systems and whether New Zealanders will use it. The Government will also consider whether the CovidCard meets high security and privacy standards, and if it can be used by a wide range of people. Contact tracing is one of the best ways we have to prevent any further spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand, and digital solutions can help make this faster and more effective. No digital solution has been proven to ‘solve’ contact tracing, so the Government is exploring all available options. It is continuing to improve the NZ COVID Tracer app and exploring how it could use Bluetooth technology to increase its effectiveness. It is also investigating the proposed CovidCard. The CovidCard is designed to be worn using a lanyard and record when it comes into ‘close contact’ with another card (within 2 metres for 15 minutes), with this information only held for 21 days. With consent, this information would be given to contact tracers if a cardholder tests positive for COVID-19. CovidCards would be identified by serial numbers and would not store personal details. Cardholder contact details would be stored in a separate database. Get support

The Government is providing certainty to businesses and workers about what support will be available in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19.  This includes a new Resurgence Support Payment to help businesses directly affected when there’s a move to Alert Level 2 or above for a week or more. This will help sectors like hospitality and events, who face particular disruptions as Alert Levels change. This recognises that some businesses face one-off costs or impacts to cashflow when we step up an Alert Level to follow public health advice. The payment is structured to provide most support to smaller firms who are most likely to face cashflow issues, but will be available to all businesses and sole traders. The payment would include a core per business rate of $1,500 plus $400 per employee up to a total of 50 FTEs ($21,500). Firms that experience a 30% drop in revenue over a 14-day period will be eligible.  The Wage Subsidy Scheme has been very effective in keeping people in work so far with more than $14 billion paid out to protect 1.8 million jobs. It will continue to be available at Alert Levels 3 and 4. Cabinet has also asked the Minister of Justice to revisit options on future commercial tenancy negotiation support — this will be discussed by Cabinet early next year.  The Leave Support Scheme will remain in place and include a new short-term absence payment to cover eligible workers who need to stay at home for 1 to 3 days while awaiting a COVID-19 test result. This will be a one-off payment of $350 to employers, available in early 2021. Other support retained includes the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, which is being extended to June 2021 with additional availability and flexibility, and Small Business Cashflow Scheme, which has also recently been extended.

The Government has made an in-principle agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica to buy up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. The agreement with Janssen is for up to 2 million vaccine doses from July 2021. There is also an option to buy up to 3 million more doses that will be delivered throughout 2022. The Janssen vaccine is likely to be a single dose, which may be more efficient to administer than other vaccine options. Janssen and its parent company Johnson & Johnson have a very strong history of producing safe and effective pharmaceutical products, giving us confidence they will develop, manufacture and deliver a safe and effective vaccine. We are working to make sure that extra agreements are in place to complete the vaccine portfolio. Our main priority is to make sure every New Zealander has access to safe and effective vaccines. Any COVID-19 vaccine used in Aotearoa must be approved by Medsafe. Safety will always be the priority — Medsafe will make sure any vaccine meets internationally agreed criteria for safety, efficacy and quality.

But we also need our health system to have sufficient capacity and support to maintain effective levels of contact tracing and testing, and for managed isolation and quarantine facilities to be fully resourced for our overall elimination strategy to work. That requires cash injections for the Ministry of Health, DHBs and agencies working at the quarantine facilities to provide funding certainty. Funding agreed by Cabinet will pay for a series of COVID-19-related health activities to June 2022, including: Further additional funding of $1.74 billion, split across the agencies involved, will ensure the MIQ operating model is fully resourced up to June 2022, including the costs of accommodation, transport, food, security and health and wellbeing services. These are significant investments that are critical to keeping our defences strong. Keeping COVID-19 out and quickly managing any incursions that do occur is an expensive business but it’s the best investment we can make for our health and our economy. As well as continuing high levels of frontline delivery, the extra health funding will enable the Ministry to enhance its oversight and policy roles and other activities through a new COVID-19 Response Directorate and to continue to make improvements to the way it operates. That includes a focus on improved Information Technology. New functions being developed include a greater role in research, more capacity to undertake infection, prevention and control audits and a beefed up policy and strategy unit. Throughout our response to COVID-19 so far, we’ve adopted a mind-set of driving constant review and improvement in the face of an unpredictable and fast evolving situation. The system of multiple interconnected agencies and portfolios is complex but has stood up well overall. Continual improvements have and continue to be made – but making substantial changes at the same time as focusing on keeping COVID-19 out has been a challenge. With much-improved testing, contact tracing and border control now in place however, the Government is in a position to consolidate and strengthen administration and governance of the response. This is increasingly essential to meet the added complexity of keeping New Zealanders safe, implementing the biggest immunisation programme in our history, while further stimulating the economy and managing a staged opening of our borders. The updated approach, to be in place by March 2021, involves: In August, the Government established an Advisory Committee, chaired by Sir Brian Roche and Heather Simpson, to review testing and surveillance systems and propose improvements. This was followed in October by a review of contact tracing performance, also led by Sir Brian Roche. The reports are independent and between them contain 28 recommendations, of which 25 are for the Ministry of Health. Overall, the Committee found that by the time the reports were being written, the required improvements, including border testing, were under way. Cabinet has this week considered an update from the Ministry and other agencies on progress against the recommendations. Actions on five of the recommendations have been completed, with 23 underway. The Ministry has all year been at the heart of a massive response to a global pandemic that a year ago no-one could have foreseen. It has continued to improve and adapt its response to COVID-19, while delivering on its many other obligations. New Zealanders should have confidence in the containment of recent community cases to date as a result of a stronger Ministry response and the hard work of public health units.

The Government has activated two new Managed Isolation facilities in Rotorua this weekend as more international flights arrive in New Zealand and stricter controls are put in place for new arrivals. There are currently 4,272 people in managed isolation facilities and with more flights expected this week, capacity has been reached in Auckland. Air Commodore Darryn Webb was appointed this week to oversee the operations of all quarantine and managed isolation facilities and has implemented new processes this weekend to protect New Zealanders. Air Commodore Webb has responsibility for the entire end to end process for Managed Isolation and Quarantine including: “As we bring more kiwis home, we need to expand our Managed Isolation facilities and review our processes to ensure border protections remain robust. Repatriation needs to happen in a safe and managed way which will impose additional inconveniences on travellers, says Air Commodore Webb. “And while I sympathise with new restrictions travellers face, I make no apologies for the tough rules that are in place. Those returning to New Zealand will require personal sacrifices in order to keep the country free of COVID-19 spread. “Government agencies worked together with the local District Health Board and hotels to open two hotels to receive returnees arriving from overseas. “These two facilities join 18 hotels in Auckland and Christchurch to provide managed isolation services to ensure the safe transition of people back into New Zealand and the community after their 14 day managed isolation. “In total, 232 returnees were transferred by seven dedicated buses from Auckland International Airport following their arrival on three flights from Australia yesterday. “The buses had a bathroom stop at Waharoa. Protocols were put in place to ensure the bathroom facilities were cleaned after the stop. “On arrival in Rotorua, returnees were moved off the bus in groups and were greeted by government and health staff. As part of the arrival process, returnees were given a briefing, completed medical forms, seen by a nurse, received food, and then taken to their rooms. As in other facilities, it was emphasised the requirement for returnees to keep physical distance from others. “Today, returnees will receive more detailed instructions, and will have the opportunity to seek welfare support and to ask any questions they have. “I acknowledge that those arriving on this flight had an expectation they were completing their managed isolation in Auckland. However, an increase in arrivals returning to New Zealand has required alternative plans to be put in place. “The plan to use the Stamford Hotel is on hold until I am satisfied it is a suitable as a Managed Isolation facility, and the Rotorua facilities had been stood up in the meantime. “We are working to address capacity due to the increase in arrivals and may look to other regions to help accommodate future arrivals. "It has been made crystal clear to the new arrivals that in addition to the rules, they must also take personal responsibility for ensuring they maintain social distancing and remain isolated from others. Everyone coming into the country needs to act like they have COVID-19. “An end to end review of the Managed Isolation and Quarantine process is due this week that will assess the: “In the meantime, the number of personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force onsite at the Managed Isolation facilities in Auckland has been doubled to 72 staff. “Police’s onsite presence has also increased, with additional staff in each facility, and specifically identified afterhours support should it be required. “These personnel will assist local staff in a number of roles, including ensuring the security and safety of returnees during their time in Managed Isolation. “Testing has been ramped up and all returnees must be tested on day three and day twelve of their stay. “We have robust systems in place, and strong accountability at both a national level through my role, and at each of the facilities through a designated onsite operational lead. “However, people must be responsible for their own actions. We did not require a police officer on every street corner during the lockdown here in New Zealand, and each New Zealander played their part. We are asking the same of returnees during their stay in managed isolation and quarantine to take responsibility for their own actions and to ensure they abide by the requirements of their stay. “Let me be very clear, people must take responsibility for their actions, and if they choose not to, there are consequences. “It is good news for thousands of travellers and their families that they can return to New Zealand where community transmission of COVID-19 has been eliminated. It is up to each and every one of them to help in maintaining this and allowing us as a nation to continue with the least restrictions in the world,” said Air Commodore Webb. Get support

The Government has today released the review of the managed isolation and quarantine and outlined the actions that are being taken to respond to issues highlighted by the review. Head of Managed Isolation and Quarantine Air Commodore Darryn Webb says significant changes have already been introduced and work is urgently underway to address other issues raised in the review report. Last week Air Commodore Webb announced a doubling of the on-the-ground Defence Force staff of 32, across 18 facilities. As of today, we have 168 Defence Force personnel across 21 facilities providing 24/7 coverage. There are also more government and defence staff across the end-to-end system. “This increased resourcing has had an immediate impact on the ground in terms of making sure our people are well supported to carry out their roles and ensure the safe transfer of returnees into managed isolation. “The increase in resourcing will form the backbone of further changes that are being made to ensure the system is robust and fit-for-purpose. “We have also increased oversight of the transfer of returnees from aircraft through to managed isolation and quarantine facilities so they are escorted by government staff.” Other improvements rolling out now include: Health responses include: “All staff supporting this process are performing to a very high standard, and have been doing so over a long period of sustained and increasing pressure. I would like to acknowledge and thank them for their ongoing work and dedication to the job. I am committed to ensuring they have the support and structures that they need to deliver well-functioning managed isolation and quarantine for all New Zealanders,” Air Commodore Webb says.

If we find it, we will stamp it out. To manage any community cases over the holidays, the Government’s COVID-19 team and the national support network are ready. The summer holiday period poses unique challenges in responding to an outbreak of COVID-19. Large numbers of people will be travelling for holidays or seasonal work, there are more social gatherings and large events such as festivals — and like other Kiwis, there will be health system workers taking well-deserved leave. New Zealanders can be reassured the planning has been extensive and has included scenario testing and understanding the actions that might be needed, including, as a last resort, Alert Level changes. More about our national COVID-19 summer resurgence plan If a positive case were found in the community, we would use the usual approach to communicating with the public — updates and advice from the Prime Minister, the COVID-19 Response Minister and/or the Director-General of Health (or his delegate). The Government’s planning has revolved around 3 broad scenarios. In each of these scenarios, extensive contingency plans are in place. We have learnt from previous cases and regional lockdowns and used that knowledge to refine our plans and preparations. We know what to do. Read about the 3 scenarios in the resurgence plan The health system is standing ready. People and resources are on call. Our supply chains are stocked. Government agencies are tightly connected and have worked closely with local government, iwi and community leaders, Civil Defence and Emergency Management and the private sector to ensure a fully coordinated response. People in remote locations where there is limited cellphone coverage would very likely be safe from exposure to COVID-19, but would need to follow public health advice upon return from those locations — this is a personal responsibility. In a worst-case scenario, if it became clear there was a high risk of widespread transmission, you would need to stay where you are in your bubble until you get official advice. We do not want people rushing home and possibly taking the virus with them. It’s important to remember that this is a worst-case scenario. After a long, hard year, we all deserve to enjoy our summer, including those who are working hard through the holidays to keep us safe. Let’s thank them by doing our bit to stop the spread of COVID-19. And if we’re going away on a break, we should also think about what we would do if we were required to stay at our holiday location while we wait for official advice. That might mean a backup plan for homes or pets if we cannot get home straight away. More about our national COVID-19 summer resurgence plan Get support

Today it was confirmed that $75 million of Official Development Assistance had been earmarked to support Pacific and global vaccine access and roll-out. Pacific countries have worked hard to keep COVID-19 out, or to stamp it out, and New Zealand has been committed to supporting them in this. But their success has been hard-won. A safe and effective vaccine will be key to the region’s economic and social recovery. New Zealand is pursuing a portfolio of potential COVID-19 vaccines to ensure there is flexibility and choice in the fast-moving global marketplace. This will ensure Pacific countries can also access suitable options, and have the support they need to run successful immunisation campaigns. The support will be flexible, given the uncertainties around vaccine development. New Zealand’s approach will be to purchase sufficient vaccines to cover the Realm of New Zealand (Tokelau, Niue, Cook Islands) and our Polynesian neighbours (Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu) should their governments wish to take these up. New Zealand is best placed to support these countries directly because of our constitutional relationships in the Realm, and the strong links between our health systems and our close people-to-people ties across Polynesia. New Zealand will also be scaling up existing health investments to play our part in vaccine roll-out. Included in the $75m support package, New Zealand plans to make a further $10m contribution to the COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment, which is the key multilateral mechanism that has emerged to support equitable global access. New Zealand is also ready to contribute to wider Pacific regional initiatives as they take shape. Get support

Bookings for seats on Air New Zealand flights into New Zealand will be managed in the short term to ensure the government is able to safely place New Zealanders arriving home into a managed isolation or quarantine facility. Air New Zealand has agreed to put a temporary hold on new bookings in the short term, as well as looking at aligning daily arrivals with the capacity available at managed isolation facilities. People who have already booked flights with Air New Zealand will still be able to enter New Zealand subject to availability of quarantine space. “We currently have nearly 6,000 people in our 28 managed isolation facilities, and are scaling up more spaces all the time, but we need to do so safely and new facilities need to be watertight before they are opened,” Air Commodore Darryn Webb said. “Standing up new capacity at the required levels for people to stay in for 14 days of isolation is a hugely complex undertaking; it needs appropriate levels of health and other services nearby, New Zealand Defence Force personnel and extra security to ensure that people are looked after properly and the risk of COVID getting out into the community is minimised. “These temporary measures will ease the current demand on facilities while additional supply is brought on line. In the past three weeks we have brought on capacity of ten new facilities for 2,000 more people, and have a plan to bring on another 750 places in the coming weeks. “The pause on new bookings will be short-term, and allows us to increase supply to match forecasted demand over the coming weeks. “We are closely monitoring the situation and working with Air New Zealand to smooth demand and ensure returnees can be safely housed in managed isolation facilities,” Darryn Webb said.

Read more about pre-departure testing requirements: Pre-departure testing for arrivals into New Zealand Work is underway to extend the requirement to other long-haul flights to New Zealand, it was confirmed today. The new PCR test requirement, foreshadowed last week, will require travellers from the UK or the US to have a written form, certified by a laboratory or another form of approved evidence, showing a negative result in the 72 hours prior to departure. It will come into force on flights arriving in New Zealand after 11.59pm on 15 January. Work is underway on similar measures for travellers using most other long-haul routes to New Zealand. We expect to be in a position to provide more details within the next week – after we get a more complete picture of testing regimes and capabilities in overseas jurisdictions. A detailed plan to put the new requirement into action in the UK and the US is being developed with airlines and will be widely communicated in time for 15 January via the Immigration NZ website and contact centre, the SafeTravel website and communications directly to airlines so they can contact booked travellers. A very limited number of people may be exempt, including if they have a medical certificate verifying they have been examined within 72 hours before departure, but are unable to undertake a test for medical reasons. Individuals who have previously had COVID-19 and recovered will also require a medical certificate as evidence. Enforcement will be managed by an amendment to New Zealand’s Air Border Order to make arriving in New Zealand without evidence of a negative approved test an infringement offence. We know this will add to the stress of travellers wanting to get to New Zealand and have made this decision carefully. It will provide further assurance for New Zealanders at a time when infections from the virus appear be accelerating overseas. The managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system remains the bedrock of our border security. The new step is a further precaution to support our goal of making summer unstoppable and is consistent with the overall elimination strategy. The pre-departure test is an additional requirement to the day zero/day one testing and stay in their room in MIQ requirement for arrivals from higher risk countries that came into force last Friday. Travellers from the UK and the US will still have to go through New Zealand’s 14-day quarantine regime. It reduces the risk of infected passengers on international flights infecting other passengers with COVID-19. We intend the test to also have an added benefit of encouraging extra-cautious behaviour before people fly and during flights and layovers that will minimise exposure to COVID-19. The Government is moving at pace to match or exceed the kinds of fast-changing travel requirements in many countries and at transit points for air routes to New Zealand. Most of the main transit hubs for flights from the United Kingdom to New Zealand require passengers to have had a negative test 72 hours prior to departure, and Japan and China have currently stopped all flights from the United Kingdom. It’s important, however, that we put our own safeguards in place. We’re at the end of long-haul flights or chains of flights and any actions we take to further strengthen our border must be based on our own unique set of circumstances. We’re stepping though the options carefully to minimise any overlapping requirements on travellers or airlines. We will announce these additional protections in stages over the coming weeks.

The change will come into force for all flights arriving in New Zealand after 11:59pm (NZT) on Monday 25 January, to minimise disruption for those travellers with imminent departures. Other countries will be considered for exclusion if their situations change. As signalled last week, given the high rates of infection in many countries, most global air routes are of critical concern for the foreseeable future. New Zealand is currently in a good position with no community cases, but we continue to take action with very specific steps to further strengthen our borders in response to what we’re seeing overseas. The expansion of Day 0/1 testing at Managed Isolation and Quarantine to all passengers to New Zealand – except for those coming from Australia, Antarctica or most Pacific Islands – is now in operation. All travellers are still required to complete 14 days mandatory isolation, including routine Day 3 and Day 12 tests. New Zealand already has some of the most stringent border protection measures in the world. Today’s amendments further strengthen that position in line with the Government’s overall elimination strategy, and more measures can be added as necessary. The primary obligation is on passengers to comply, but airlines are also expected to play a key role in checking documentation where practicable at the start of someone’s journey. We recognise and appreciate the efforts of their staff. Customs staff will check travellers’ arrival cards and inspect test documentation for all arrivals except for those who are exempt. Last week, we specified exemptions and provided information to assist travellers with the new requirements via covid19.govt.nz and Unite Against COVID-19 social media, and directly to airlines. They will apply to all the countries that have been added. It is critical we acknowledge that these new requirements add complexity for people wanting to get here – and ensure support is in place. We thank them for their cooperation, as it’s what’s helping keep New Zealand safe while cases continue to accelerate overseas. So far, after four days of flights arriving with travellers from the US and UK, we are seeing extremely high levels of compliance. It’s great to see people doing the right thing for their fellow passengers, airline staff and the New Zealand public. From 8 February, all passengers arriving in New Zealand except those from exempted countries without evidence of a negative approved test or medical certificate would incur an infringement offence fee or a fine not exceeding $1,000.

Latest information on managed isolation charges (external link) The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to only charge New Zealanders who enter temporarily, or who leave New Zealand after regulations come into force. Temporary visa holders would have to pay unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand before the border closure, and left before the border closure. The Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to set payment terms, exempt groups of people and waive charges in cases of financial hardship. It will also ensure that: Check the progress of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill through Parliament (external link) The proposed charging structure for managed isolation and quarantine will be: The system has been designed so that it is fair on arrivals and not a barrier for returning to New Zealand, especially for those who might already be experiencing financial stress. It is forecast that more people will be travelling and arriving at the border. The Government has set aside a total of $479 million to pay for the costs of managed isolation facilities until the end of the year. Further details of the charging scheme, and when it will come into force, will be announced soon. Once the regulations come into force, it is proposed New Zealanders, residents and temporary visa holders will have to pay charges: Flowchart: Proposed liability for managed isolation and quarantine charges [PDF, 216 KB] Classes of people, such as the following, are proposed not to be liable for charges: Flowchart: Proposed liability for managed isolation and quarantine charges [PDF, 216 KB] New Zealanders who are currently overseas (that is, who left before the regulations come into force) will not have to pay if they stay in New Zealand for 90 days or longer. If you leave New Zealand after the regulations come into force, it is proposed that you would have to pay for your managed isolation unless you qualify for a waiver or are otherwise exempt. Anyone who needs to come home but cannot afford the charges, will still be able to come home. It is proposed that regulations allow the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment to waive charges in full or in part if they consider that undue financial hardship will be caused by the payment of the charges, or in any circumstances (which could include compassionate grounds) for which they consider a full or partial waiver appropriate. This will allow the chief executive to take into consideration an individual’s full circumstances. Final decisions on this will be announced soon. It is impossible to tell how the situation develops internationally and in New Zealand. Our priority is keeping New Zealand safe. The Government is working to make the system sustainable and manageable for as long as we need it and it is expected the system will be amended as appropriate. Our experience from February and March 2020, before managed isolation and quarantine was introduced, showed that compliance with self-isolation requirements by people arriving in New Zealand was patchy and could not be relied on. Final decisions on this will be announced soon. Get support

As the person works at the facility and is not a returnee they are treated as a community case. Both this case, and the one reported on Monday, came into contact with the international mariners in the course of their duties, including some of the 31 mariners who have tested positive to COVID-19 and who remain in quarantine. The individual was tested as part of the routine testing for staff in the facility and returned a negative test on Thursday 29 October. They are asymptomatic and were retested after being identified as being a close work contact of the case reported on Monday and a positive result was received today. The person is now in isolation at home and transfer is being arranged to a managed isolation facility. The initial assessment is that there are only 2 close contacts of this current case, both household contacts, both are now being tested and both are in isolation at home. At this stage the Ministry is not advising of any need to change the current approach. Both cases have limited numbers of contacts and the incident is currently well contained. The first of the international mariners, due to complete their managed isolation this morning, have had their managed isolation extended for at least a further 48 hours as an additional precautionary measure while further information from the current round of staff testing is gathered. Those precautionary measures have included additional tests — up to 4 tests for some individuals — and an already lengthened stay in managed isolation. The genome sequencing of the case announced on Monday is not expected to be completed until this evening and will be reported tomorrow. Further details of the case if available, and the actions taken in response will be provided tomorrow at a 1pm media conference.

Thanks to the fast actions of police and Defence Force staff, a person has been caught unlawfully leaving a managed isolation facility in Auckland. About 1pm on 30 July, a 32-year-old left the Crowne Plaza and was caught by police 100 metres away. Defence Force staff verbally challenged the man as he attempted to follow them out a gate, claiming he was a worker. When asked for identification he allegedly refused, and exited onto Albert St. Aviation Security Service (Avsec) and police were immediately alerted, and 2 Defence Force staff followed the man down Albert St, maintaining a safe distance while doing so until a police officer arrived. The officer was wearing a mask and gloves. The man allegedly failed to stop, and was chased for a short distance and apprehended. The man arrived from Brisbane on 29 July, and has not received his COVID-19 testing yet. His day 3 test is scheduled for 1 August. As the returnee has yet to be tested, the police officer who arrested him is following all necessary precautions. The man has been summonsed to appear in court at a later date. Get support

Today’s two positive test results from individuals in managed isolation re-enforce the measures put in place in relation to the assurance needed for returnees leaving after their 14 day stay, says Air Commodore Darryn Webb, Head of Managed Isolation and Quarantine. “As the Director General of Health announced earlier today, COVID-19 tests on day 12 for two individuals in managed isolation came back positive, resulting in the standard response to ensure the safety of those involved,” Air Commodore Webb says. “When we were notified of the positive test results, the on-site operational lead and health staff were notified, who activated our standard operating procedures when a positive test is returned, and the individuals were confined to their room. The hotel facility was also placed into a full lockdown this morning. “All other returnees were also directed to return and remain in their rooms until further notice. This does mean those returnees who received a negative day 12 result will not be allowed to leave after their 14 days, until further advice from the Ministry of Health is received. “Earlier today, those individuals involved were moved from the managed isolation facility to the quarantine facility with the appropriate health (including personal protective equipment) and safety protocols in place to ensure all individuals involved, including staff, remain safe.” Further to the standard protocols in moving the individuals to the quarantine facilities, staff have reviewed security camera footage and a deep clean of all public areas has been completed. As the Director General of Health also spoke to, on-site contact tracing has been initiated for these two individuals, and we will assist in facilitating this where necessary. “Our measures at the border and in managed isolation and quarantine are our last line of defence while we remain in a global pandemic. “As I reiterated yesterday, both publicly and to staff on the ground, no one is to leave without a negative test result on day 12 of their 14 day managed isolation period. “Today’s cases have shown us the importance of ensuring these tests are undertaken, and the results received before authorising anyone to depart a facility.” The following process is used when moving a confirmed positive case from a managed isolation facility to the quarantine facility: I would like to clarify a statement was made earlier today regarding the use of the Stamford Hotel. I can confirm that the Stamford Hotel has not been used as a managed isolation facility. I can also confirm that, as part of our normal process to assess the suitability of a hotel as a facility, the Stamford is being assessed as a facility. However, no final decisions have been made.

Systems on track to deliver first vaccines to border workers in in the 2nd quarter of 2021, with vaccination of general population in second half of the year. COVID-19 vaccine strategy at a glance [PDF, 66 KB] The Government will purchase COVID-19 vaccines from pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Novavax, meaning every New Zealander will be able to be vaccinated. The new agreements secure access to 7.6 million doses from AstraZeneca — enough for 3.8 million people, and 10.72 million doses from Novavax — enough for 5.36 million people. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered. The four pre-purchase agreements secured to date are: There are multiple types of vaccine technology that have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Our strategy has been to purchase different types of technology, to ensure if some are found in development or in trials not to be a successful option we will have alternatives available. We now have agreements in place with four providers, covering three different types of vaccine technology and we have secured more than enough doses to cover our entire population plus the Pacific. The AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines announced today complement our other purchases, and are compatible with existing infrastructure and storage facilities in New Zealand. If proven to be safe and effective by New Zealand’s pharmaceuticals regulator Medsafe, they will provide broad population coverage for New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours. Eventually, everyone in the country will have access to a vaccine free of charge. This will be New Zealand’s largest immunisation roll out ever. Most countries are factoring the roll out to take all of 2021 and some of 2022 to complete due to its scale and complexity, also due to production and delivery timeframes. The first priority will be to vaccinate border workers and essential staff who are at the greatest risk of getting COVID-19. Vaccines are expected to be delivered to front line workers in the second quarter of 2021. The aim is to then commence vaccination of the general public in the second half of the year. All vaccine roll out will be dependent on Medsafe sign off, which we are streamlining, and speed of manufacture. We are moving as fast as we can, but we also want to ensure the vaccine is safe for New Zealanders. Never before has the entire globe sought to vaccinate the entire population at the same time. This will be a sustained roll out over months not weeks but our pre-purchase agreements means New Zealand is well positioned to get on with it as soon as it is proven safe to do so. The agreements ensure that we are invested in a range of options and that we’re not putting all of our eggs into one basket. As there are no guarantees that all the vaccines will successfully complete clinical trials, or be approved for use, this approach ensures we are able to access safe and effective vaccines at the earliest possible time. Our plan is to ensure no-one misses out, even if it means we’ve purchased more than we need. It’s an investment worth making. The world of vaccine development is dynamic. While we’re confident our four agreements place us in an excellent position, we’re not ruling out other purchases if required. The Government’s portfolio approach works alongside other aspects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy, including membership of the global COVAX Facility, which is also an avenue for securing vaccines. Preparations are well in hand to gear up for what would be New Zealand’s largest ever immunisation programme. New Zealand has never before attempted an immunisation programme of this scale and complexity. We’re putting all of the building blocks in place to make it run as seamlessly as possible. Workforce planning to ensure we have enough vaccinators is well advanced. There are around 12,000 health professionals already able to administer vaccines and more will be trained. And, as part of the new National Immunisation Solution, the Ministry of Health will have an inventory management system for COVID-19 vaccines with accurate information about where they are located and the temperature in central storage facilities. This will enable us to track and trace COVID-19 vaccines and consumables, including their expiry dates, to reduce wastage. The Ministry has also purchased nine large minus 80 degree Celsius freezers that can store more than 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They are on track to arrive by the end of the year.   The start of COVID-19 immunisation will not mean any changes to our borders initially. Our border remains the first line of defence against COVID-19 from imported cases. To make any decisions around borders we need to be confident that the New Zealand population is sufficiently protected. It means we will need information on whether the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at providing individuals with protection from contracting the virus and reducing transmission – and a gradual building towards population immunity, which will take time. Our technical advisory teams will be monitoring data from clinical trials and learning from the experience of other countries.  Currently, given we have no community transmission, the first group who would be immunised are those most at risk of being exposed to COVID-19. This includes the border and MIQ workforce, the COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers, and their household contacts. This will further strengthen our border. The aim of this approach is to create a layer of protection around the country to prevent any spread of COVID-19 into our communities. Officials are continuing to review the evidence, and monitor information about the vaccine characteristics, so we will continue to provide updates on the approach to sequencing as we get more information. We’re aiming to start vaccinating this group during the second quarter of 2021, followed by the public, in stages, from the third quarter. We’re factoring into our planning a large number of complex and interconnected individual strands, including the safety approval process, global supply chains, as well as lead-in times to manufacture and ship vaccines in bulk quantities. Sequencing the roll out of COVID-19 vaccines [PDF, 33 KB] Medsafe has agreed to allow pharmaceutical companies to make rolling applications for their COVID-19 vaccines, which means they may submit their data as it is completed and ready for assessment to speed up the process. Pfizer and BioNTech and Janssen have already started to submit data, and timing around Medsafe’s approval process depends on many factors, such as the data that companies provide and whether it meets internationally agreed criteria for safety and efficacy. Medsafe has streamlined its assessment processes and is prioritising the assessment of COVID-19 vaccines over other pharmaceuticals to obtain a vaccine more quickly, but there will be no compromise on the safety of the vaccine. Medsafe will remain in close contact with its Australian counterpart throughout. Get support

A detailed interview with the case has been conducted by Auckland Regional Public Health Service. They have now been moved to the Auckland quarantine facility today. We have identified 3 close contacts, and they are all being followed up, isolated, and tested. Close contacts include a colleague of the case, and 2 friends. They all report being well. The 2 friends are being transferred to the Auckland quarantine facility as a precaution. 1 of the friends lives alone in the Vincent Residences, the same as the case. Following interviews with the case, Health authorities are in the process of confirming a number of locations of interest that the person visited while possibly infectious. Check if you have visited a location of interest If you work in central Auckland, we are asking you to work from home where possible. If you must go into this area, please use masks and maintain physical distance while health authorities continue work to trace the source of this infection. Advice if you’re in Auckland There have been media reports around a fire alarm at the managed isolation facility at the Grand Millennium that saw returnees on the street near today’s case’s accommodation. The fire alarm was 8pm on Monday 9 November. This is not likely to be a source of infection for this case because she was already symptomatic earlier that day. 1 community case is connected to the November quarantine cluster — Case C. They are a close contact of Case B and tested positive on 11 November. Case C met Case B for lunch in Wellington at the Little Penang restaurant on The Terrace on Friday afternoon. On developing symptoms on Saturday they self-isolated at home and had a COVID-19 test. Although initially returning a negative result on day 3, they were moved to quarantine at the Grand Mercure in Wellington as a precaution on Tuesday.

For the most up-to-date information about our managed isolation and quarantine facilities visit the managed isolation and quarantine website. Get information about: Managed isolation and quarantine website (external link)  New Zealand is at Alert Level 1. The disease is contained in New Zealand, but uncontrolled overseas. It is safe for all business to operate as normal. It is safe for events and activities to go ahead. Controls exist at the borders to address the risk of importing COVID-19, and keep New Zealand safe. All people arriving in New Zealand are required to stay in a managed isolation or quarantine facility for at least 14 days and test negative for COVID-19. Other than the border measures there are no other restrictions in place for New Zealanders. There is a robust system in place to safely welcome New Zealanders home, while keeping our communities protected. You have a legal right to come home if you are: People from any other countries are unable to enter New Zealand at this time, unless they have specific grounds for exemption, such as being essential workers or for medical reasons. These people will need to apply to Immigration New Zealand for an exception to the border closure. Immigration NZ has the most up to date information on the border exception criteria and process (external link) Those returning to New Zealand must do their part to stop COVID-19 spreading in New Zealand. All arrivals must complete 14 days of managed isolation or quarantine and test negative for COVID-19 before they can enter the community. People without symptoms will isolate at a managed isolation facility, and those with symptoms or who test positive will isolate in a quarantine facility or separate area. Managed Isolation and Quarantine (external link) Carrying out managed isolation and quarantine throughout regions across New Zealand is a key part of our border management. All facilities used for isolation or quarantine are closely monitored to make sure all the measures are in place to keep New Zealand safe. New Zealand currently has managed isolation facilities in: None of the hotels being used as managed isolation facilities are currently open to domestic travellers or guests — they are exclusive to people who have recently arrived in New Zealand. These facilities are operating safely and are carefully managed with security. The hotels are stand-alone facilities — there are no shared public spaces with other members of the community. In total there are more than 500 government and contracted staff directly supporting managed isolation and quarantine. Each quarantine and managed isolation facility has an All of Government support team. Each team works alongside facility management to support the health, wellbeing, security, supplementary logistics and administration of the people staying in the facility. The teams vary in size depending on facility capacity, and include people from the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Defence Force, Police, Aviation Security, and the Ministry of Social Development. Managed isolation and quarantine facilities meet a strict set of criteria to ensure people staying and working in them are kept safe, and that there’s a safe transition of people back into the community after their isolation period. Hotels are chosen based on demand and suitability. Selection includes an assessment by the national Isolation, Quarantine and Repatriation team, and site visits from our on-the-ground teams in the respective locations. Hotels must meet a range of criteria including security, entry/exit points, suitable room and bathroom facilities, provision of food and drink delivered to rooms, safe laundry protocols, and the ability to ensure the wellbeing of people. People arriving in New Zealand need to complete their at least 14-days stay in a managed isolation or quarantine facility to ensure they can return safely to their family and friends. People will be tested for COVID-19 around days three and 12 of their stay. They must also have a negative test before they are released. Managed isolation facilities are closely monitored to make sure all measures needed to keep the local community safe are in place. None of the facilities have shared spaces with the public or wider community. There is a robust process in place if a potential case is identified in an isolation facility, including isolation of any close or casual contacts. You may see staff on the ground in the community who work at managed isolation facilities. These people are following all public health guidance. People who are in managed isolation cannot leave the hotel until they complete 14 days and return a negative COVID-19 test. For everyone else, it is safe to be out and about in the community as normal. It is safe for all business to operate as normal. It is safe for events and activities to go ahead. Other than the border measures, including managed isolation and quarantine, there are no other restrictions in place for New Zealanders.

Latest information on managed isolation charges (external link) The Bill allowing the Government to recover some costs for managed isolation and quarantine passed its third reading today, and the charges will come into force as soon as regulations are finalised. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill and its supporting regulations will introduce a new charging system for managed isolation to balance the rights of New Zealanders to return home and help reduce pressure on the system. The proposed charges are: There will be no charge for children under the age of 3. These charges are GST inclusive. Charging will start soon after the regulations come into force. This will happen after the Bill is given Royal Assent. The start date of the charging regime will be published on www.miq.govt.nz (external link) as soon as it is confirmed. The following exemptions are proposed: Waiver applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is proposed that waivers will be available in cases of undue financial hardship and other special circumstances. These special circumstances could include: People will be able to apply for waivers once the regulations are in force. Information about the process will be available on www.miq.govt.nz at that time. Returnees who need to pay will get an invoice at the end of their stay in managed isolation and will generally have 90 days to pay. Information about how to pay the fee will be provided on the invoice. Get support
