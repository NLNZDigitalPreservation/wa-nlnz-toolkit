It has 3 traffic light settings of Red, Orange and Green. The framework aims to: help people protect one another from the virus keep hospitalisation rates as low as possible and avoid overwhelming the health system minimise the impact of large outbreaks reduce the need for lockdowns. It also aims to give people and businesses more stability. At all traffic light settings, essential services will continue to operate. This includes supermarkets, health services, emergency services, goods transport, and utilities such as power and water supplies. A high vaccination rate is a key tool to protect people and minimise the spread of COVID-19. Getting vaccinated means you are less likely to get extremely sick or infect other people. Some workplaces may require staff to be vaccinated. Vaccine mandates for many government workers ended during 2022. Wearing face masks is a way we can protect ourselves and others. At Red and Orange traffic light settings, there are some places you must wear a mask, such as on public transport and in supermarkets. At Red, capacity limits apply in some indoor settings. Limits are based on 1-metre distancing, which means 1 metre square of space for each person, up to the maximum capacity limit. It does not mean everyone must stay 1 metre apart. Capacity limits do not include workers (paid and unpaid). If an area has very high infection rates, extra restrictions such as local lockdowns or other protective steps may be used. Examples of protective steps include: stay at home orders closing premises, such as schools or shops limiting numbers allowed at gatherings.

      "The **traffic light system** is New Zealand’s COVID‑19 Protection Framework that categorises the country’s risk level into three colours—**Red, Orange, and Green**—and ties each colour to a set of health‑and‑public‑safety rules.\n",

      "| Colour | What it means | Typical measures |\n",
      "|--------|--------------|------------------|\n",
      "| **Red** | Highest risk of community spread and pressure on the health system. | Masks required in many indoor spaces, capacity limits (based on 1‑metre distancing), possible local lockdowns or closures of schools, shops, or gatherings; stricter testing and isolation protocols. |\n",
      "| **Orange** | Moderate‑to‑high transmission with rising risks. | Masks still mandatory in public transport and supermarkets, some limits on indoor gatherings, relaxed testing rules compared to Red, but still protective measures in place. |\n",
      "| **Green** | Low community transmission; health services are ready to respond. | No mandatory masks, no capacity limits, normal business operations, and minimal restrictions. |\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated a complete workflow for processing and analyzing text extracted from web archives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extraction**: Converting web archive HTML to plain text\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and deduplicating text data\n",
    "3. **Semantic Search**: Finding content based on meaning using vector embeddings\n",
    "4. **Question Answering**: Building an AI system that can answer questions about the corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques enable researchers to extract valuable insights from web archives, making historical web content more accessible and useful for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different embedding models for improved search quality\n",
    "- Apply topic modeling to discover themes in the corpus\n",
    "- Integrate with larger language models for more sophisticated question answering"
