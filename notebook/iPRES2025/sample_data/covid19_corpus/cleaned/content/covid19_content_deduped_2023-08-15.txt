Home Current phase of our COVID-19 response New Zealand’s COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic lights) has ended. With case numbers low, most COVID-19 rules were removed on 13 September 2022. What you need to know If you have COVID-19 How to self-isolate Household Contacts Get free RATs Face masks International travel Close Contacts Antivirals --- Section Separator --- Protecting lives and livelihoods remains the goal of the Government’s COVID-19 response. It is now possible to do this with fewer requirements, giving greater certainty to people, businesses and communities. With case numbers falling, a highly vaccinated population, and increased access to antiviral medicines to treat COVID-19, public health experts say it is safe to remove most COVID-19 rules and end border restrictions. Thanks to the efforts of New Zealanders throughout the pandemic, we have saved thousands of lives. As well as each person and family who has followed the rules, we thank iwi and Māori health providers, Pacific organisations, aged care providers, businesses, schools and other education providers who have made extraordinary efforts to protect people and communities. Isolation is our main tool to manage the spread of the virus. It is the most effective way to keep case numbers low. Isolating for 7 days remains a requirement for everyone who tests positive. To monitor for new variants arriving from overseas, the Government will continue to use: follow-up PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests and genome sequencing of positive cases in travellers targeted surveillance at the border. COVID-19 has taken a toll on everyone’s mental health. Effective mental health tools are available to help people recover from the impact of the pandemic. Looking after your mental wellbeing --- Section Separator --- From 13 September 2022 you must still: isolate for 7 days if you have COVID-19 wear a face mask in certain healthcare facilities, such as hospitals. Some places may continue to ask people to wear a face mask. How to self-isolate (external link) Wearing a face mask (external link) Household Contacts no longer need to isolate for 7 days. If you live with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, we recommend you: take a rapid antigen test (RAT) each day for 5 days avoid contact with the person who has COVID-19. Household Contacts (external link) Antiviral medicines are available for people at risk of becoming very sick with COVID-19, including: any New Zealander aged 65 or older Māori and Pacific peoples aged 50 or older anyone with 3 high-risk conditions. This will help protect our vulnerable communities. Medicines to treat COVID-19 (external link) All government vaccine mandates have ended. Some employers may still require workers to be vaccinated due to health and safety. Travellers and crew do not need proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter New Zealand. Please check with your travel provider, for example, your airline, as they may still require proof of vaccination. If you have COVID-19 symptoms when you arrive in New Zealand by air, we encourage you to take a rapid antigen test (RAT). You can get free RATs at the airport.

The Government is removing the remaining COVID-19 public health requirements, effective from 12:01am tomorrow, Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall announced today. While fluctuations from week to week are expected, overall COVID-19 case rates, wastewater levels and hospitalisations have been trending downwards since the beginning of June and over the past month reported COVID-19 cases have hit their lowest since February 2022. Ayesha Verrall says the public health risk from COVID-19 is now considered low compared to other stages of the pandemic and it’s safe to remove the final requirements. “While our case numbers will continue to fluctuate, we have not seen the dramatic peaks that characterised COVID-19 rates last year. Covid has put considerably less pressure on the health system this winter and other illnesses have been better planned for and managed. “This, paired with the population’s immunity levels, means Cabinet and I consider we’re positioned to safely remove the remaining COVID-19 requirements. “We’ve only reached this point thanks to the hard work and care New Zealanders have taken over the course of the pandemic. “And while not mandated, the Ministry of Health guidance is to stay at home for five days if you’re unwell or have tested positive for COVID-19,” Ayesha Verrall said. COVID-19 accounted for 2.2% of hospital admissions this morning and New Zealand has now likely passed the winter influenza peak. “It has been a long road, however thanks to lots of hard work, New Zealand’s COVID-19 approach has moved from an emergency response to sustainable long-term management. “Mask wearing remains an important way we can prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, in health and disability care settings. COVID-19 changed the world. It was an unknown to virtually all of us. I appreciate from the top of the North Island to the bottom of the South the efforts Kiwis took to keep themselves and their community safe,” said Ayesha Verrall.
