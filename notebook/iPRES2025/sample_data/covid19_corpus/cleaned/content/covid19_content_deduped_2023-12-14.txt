Home COVID-19 vaccines Get your COVID-19 vaccination Everyone in Aotearoa New Zealand aged 5 and over can get a free COVID-19 vaccine now. You can get a booster if you are aged 16 or over. What you need to know Children 6 months to 4 years Vaccine side effects Boosters If you have a health condition Child aged 5 to 11 Vaccine advice for disabled people If you are pregnant or breastfeeding --- Section Separator --- Pfizer is the preferred COVID-19 vaccine for use in New Zealand. If you are 18 years of age or older and either cannot get the Pfizer vaccine or want a different option, you can get the Novavax vaccine. You will be given the option to choose your vaccine type when you book. The Novavax vaccine is not available at all vaccination sites. Whichever vaccine you get, you will need 2 doses. COVID-19 vaccines are free. COVID-19 vaccines used in New Zealand Like all medicines, you might experience some mild side effects in the days after getting your vaccination. This is common, and a sign that your body is learning to fight the virus. Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines --- Section Separator --- Having COVID-19 does not provide the same level of immunity as getting vaccinated. We also know that your protection from the primary course of the vaccine decreases over time. To keep your immunity levels high, stay up to date with your vaccinations — including boosters. This will lower your chances of getting very sick from COVID-19 and ending up in hospital. Boosters provide an extra layer of protection to previous vaccination and help your immunity be stronger and last longer. The Pfizer BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine is now the vaccine used for boosters. If you have had COVID-19 and are eligible for a booster, you can get it 6 months after you tested positive. COVID-19 vaccine boosters --- Section Separator --- It is free, fast and easy to book or change your appointments using the website Book My Vaccine.

Home COVID-19 vaccines Side effects --- Section Separator --- Like all medicines, you might experience some mild side effects in the days after getting your vaccination. This is common, and a sign that your body is learning to fight the virus. Most side effects do not last long, and will not stop you from having a second dose or going about your daily life. Some side effects may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machinery. The most common reported reactions are: pain or swelling at the injection site feeling tired or fatigued headache muscle aches chills joint pain fever redness at the injection site nausea. Some side effects are more common after the second dose. Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are similar in young people to those seen in adults. You can: place a cold, wet cloth or ice pack on the injection site for a short time rest and drink plenty of fluids take paracetamol or ibuprofen. Some side effects are more serious but rare, such as a severe allergic reaction. Serious allergic reactions or anaphylaxis from the vaccine are rare. This is why people are watched for around 15 minutes post-vaccination. Vaccinators are well trained in managing these if they occur. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the tissue forming a sac around the heart. These conditions are usually caused by viral infections including COVID-19, but they are also very rare and serious side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis linked to the vaccine generally appear within a few days, and mostly within the first few weeks after having the vaccine. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include: tightness, heaviness, discomfort or pain in your chest or neck difficulty breathing or catching your breath feeling faint or dizzy or light-headed fluttering, racing or pounding heart, or feeling like it is 'skipping beats'. If you get any of these symptoms after your Pfizer or Novavax vaccination, promptly get medical help — for example from your doctor or after-hours medical service. You can also call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 at any time to get advice. If you need urgent medical help, call 111 . Tell them you have had a COVID-19 vaccination so they can assess you properly. Also tell them if you have COVID-19, or have had it. Children are less likely to have these side effects but may not tell you about the symptoms. We recommend you ask your child how they feel after being vaccinated. A rare but serious side effect is a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). These reactions usually happen soon after your vaccination, which is why you need to wait at least 15 minutes. If you do have a serious allergic reaction, vaccinators are trained to help. COVID-19: Vaccine side effects and reactions | Ministry of Health (external link) It is recommended you do not have Novavax if you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or to any component of the vaccine. Getting Novavax | Ministry of Health (external link) Side effects of booster doses are like those from primary vaccine doses. These include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, nausea and feeling tired or fatigued. If you feel any of these serious side effect symptoms in the days or weeks after the vaccine, you should see a doctor or other health professional. You can also call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 anytime to get advice. If you have an immediate concern about your safety, call 111. Tell them you have had a COVID-19 vaccination, or have or had COVID-19 so they can assess you properly. For information about uncommon and rare side effects, visit the Ministry of Health website. Uncommon and rare side effects | Ministry of Health (external link) If you have had a severe or immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection in the past, tell your vaccinator when you arrive. Serious allergic reactions do happen but are extremely rare. If you have a reaction when getting the vaccine, a health worker will be there to look after you and make sure you are okay. Reporting COVID-19 vaccine side effects means the safety of the Pfizer vaccine within Aotearoa New Zealand can be closely monitored. You can report your own side effects, or side effects experienced by someone else (including a child). You do not have to be certain the vaccine caused the side effects to make a report. Side effects are reported to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM). Medsafe closely monitors and releases safety reports showing this data. Report your side effects (external link) Learn more about CARM | New Zealand Pharmacovigilance Centre (external link) If you get a Pfizer booster, or a child in your care has had a paediatric (child) Pfizer vaccine, you may be invited by text to let us know about any side effects experienced in the days after. This is called a Post Vaccine Symptom Check. The text invite will come from the Ministry of Health, and you will be asked to reply ‘YES’, ‘NO’, or ‘STOP'. All replies are free of charge. If you want to take part, you will be sent a link to an online form.

Providing antiviral medicine for COVID-19 to eligible people will become the key focus of primary and community pharmacy care from 1 October, ensuring people most at risk of serious outcomes from the virus receive the support they need. Most people who get COVID-19 have a mild to moderate illness and can safely recover at home, while others at higher risk of serious outcomes can benefit significantly from antiviral medicine. The continued support with a focus on antiviral medicine reflects the transition to managing COVID-19 in the same way as other acute respiratory conditions. Antiviral medicine will be available in both primary care and community pharmacy for those who meet Pharmac's access criteria.  This supports those at higher risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19, including hospitalisation, free of charge. Emphasis is also being placed on the importance of people staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations. “Having the latest COVID-19 vaccination or booster will help protect those most at risk from serious illness,” says Dr William Rainger, National Public Health Service, Te Whatu Ora. “We also recommend anyone testing positive, using a Rapid Antigen Test or RAT, to stay at home and isolate for 5 days and report the result through My Covid Record. “They should also wear a mask if they need to leave isolation for any reason, and not visit a healthcare location, except to access medical care, or where there may be people at higher risk. While no longer mandated, isolating and mask wearing remain important in preventing the spread of COVID-19, as well as other respiratory illnesses. “We are encouraging people to check the Pharmac website and ask their doctor, pharmacist or hauora provider if they think they, or someone in their whānau, may be eligible for free antiviral medicines.” People can get a prescription for antivirals from their doctor or hauora provider, and many pharmacies can supply antiviral medicine without a prescription. “The primary care and pharmacy sector has worked incredibly hard this year and shown us how well we can deliver antiviral medicines for COVID-19.  This has had a very positive impact and kept New Zealanders safe. We’d really like to thank those providing care and are pleased we can continue this support as we move into the summer of 2023 and next year,” says Dr Rainger. The new Model of Care, with its focus on those most at risk and providing antiviral medicine to those who are eligible, is expected to be in place until 29th February 2024, with funding being reviewed in December 2023 as part of the Half Year Financial Update.

They are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. We recommend you wear a face mask when visiting healthcare service providers. This is especially important when visiting people who are at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell, like: older people and kaumātua people living in aged residential care facilities patients in hospital people with other health conditions babies disabled people. Face masks are also very useful when in closed, crowded and confined spaces with poor ventilation. Spring and summer are the seasons when people come together socially more often, there are more large-scale public events, and people move around the country in bigger numbers. During this time of year, we encourage you to wear a face mask when on public transport, around crowds of people, and when you have close contact with someone else, such as during face-to-face conversations. To be effective, a face mask should: cover your nose, mouth and chin be well-fitting so there are no gaps above, below or on the sides be used correctly and consistently not be damp, damaged or dirty. A face mask that is not worn correctly may become ineffective. It may not offer enough protection for you or those around you against COVID-19 spreading. How to wear a face mask safely Wearing a face mask Different types of face masks provide different levels of protection, depending on the type of mask. You should choose a face mask that best fits you and suits your needs. There are several things you should think about when choosing a face mask for you. This includes: your risk of illness from COVID-19 how well the face mask fits you layers and the filtration ability of the material comfort of the face mask. Disposable face masks with ear loops or ties can offer better protection for a longer period than fabric face masks. Especially when you are in a higher-risk indoor setting. These are the widely available ‘blue’ medical masks. They are often called ‘medical’, ‘surgical’ and ‘procedural’ masks. For use in healthcare, they must comply to a certain standard. Many medical masks may not be certified to medical standards, but still provide effective protection. You can find these at many retail stores, supermarkets or pharmacies. Some relevant social services agencies or organisations may also be able to provide some. To make these masks fit better and get a snug fit: pinch the nose wire place a fabric mask over top knot the ear loops where they attach to the mask, then fold and tuck excess material under the edges try pulling the ear loops back and securing them with a hair tie or clip. How to wear a face mask correctly Try to avoid twisting the ear loop into a figure 8, as this will likely cause a side gap that could let virus particles in. Double masking or layering can provide greater protection. The other layer, preferably a fabric mask, can help stop any leaks around the top and sides of the bottom mask. To reuse these masks, you can soak them in warm, hot or boiling water for a few minutes and hang them out to dry. You can do this up to 10 times. When they start to show wear or no longer have a good fit, dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. You can use a fabric face mask. The effectiveness of fabric face masks can vary depending on the style and materials used. You should look for reusable fabric face masks that have at least 3 layers and are made of tightly woven fabric, such as cotton. Ideally face masks should also use 2 different types of fabric that still allow easy breathing but provide filtration and a good fit. Face masks with more than one layer will help contain any respiratory droplets. You can increase protection of your fabric face mask by adding a ‘filter layer’ and a nose bridge wire to mould the face mask to your face. A filter layer could be a specific face mask filter or a cut-down disposable face mask to add to a face mask pocket. Fabric face masks can still be effective for short periods of time in well-ventilated areas. Taking care of your face mask is important. You should wash fabric face masks daily after use, using soap and hot water, and completely dry them before using again. You should have enough face masks to at least wash one and wear one. Check for wear and tear to make sure there are no holes and they are still in good condition. Many stores and online retailers offer these types of face masks. You can also make your own but make sure it has at least 3 layers. How to make a face covering Disposable high-filtration face masks or particulate respirators offer the highest level of protection when used correctly. For people who are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19, the use of a P2/N95 face mask may be a better choice for you. If you choose to wear this type of face mask, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to mould these face masks to your face. You need to make sure there are no gaps and you have a tight seal against your face. These face masks can offer hours of protection when in high-risk indoor settings where there is no or little ventilation. But they need to have a tight seal around the face to provide better protection than a well-fitting medical mask. In healthcare settings, these face masks work best when a person is ‘fit tested’ to make sure they have the right type of face mask that suits their face. Do not wash these face masks. These face masks have a special static charge that traps viruses. You can reuse these face masks several times if you leave them for a few days between each use in a cool, dry place. If they no longer provide a tight seal around your face, or are dirty or damaged, then you should dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. Particulate respirator face masks come in a variety of models, prices, availability and suitability. They are often identified by which international regulatory standard they meet. P2 is the Australia/New Zealand respiratory standard. N95 is the United States respiratory standard. KN95 is the Chinese respiratory standard. FFP2 is the European respiratory standard. Children aged 5 or under are generally not recommended to wear a mask. Children between 6 and 11 years of age are encouraged to wear a mask at the discretion and supervision of their caregiver. Choose a face mask for children that fits them best, is comfortable to wear and can be worn consistently. The face mask should cover their nose, mouth, and chin without gaps above, below or on the sides. This can be a reusable fabric mask with 3 layers or a medical disposable mask. Many fabric masks (either purchased or made) come in child sizes. For commonly available medical masks, you can use the knot and tuck technique to improve the fit to a child's face. How to make a face mask fit well These types of face masks or coverings provide very little protection against transmission of COVID-19. A face shield is not recommended to be worn instead of a face mask as it will provide very little protection against droplets or aerosols. Dust masks or particulate respirators that have a 1-way valve are not recommended as they can allow particles from you to spread to others. Masks that are showing wear and tear. If there is any thinning of the material, holes, or the ties or elastic loops can no longer keep the mask in place, you should replace it. --- Section Separator --- Some healthcare facilities and certain areas within healthcare facilities may ask visitors to wear a face mask.
