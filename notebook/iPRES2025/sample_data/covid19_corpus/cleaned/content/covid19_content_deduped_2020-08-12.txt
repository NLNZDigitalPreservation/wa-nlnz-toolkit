Keeping track of where we’ve been is 1 way we can be prepared. To stop the spread of COVID-19, we need to trace the contacts of anyone who has been exposed to COVID-19. Recording people’s movements helps us to do this quickly and efficiently. The faster we can trace contacts, the faster we can prevent further spread of the disease.

But, businesses should help customers to keep track of where they’ve been by displaying the NZ COVID Tracer QR code poster. The Ministry of Health has created a tracing app called NZ COVID Tracer. This app works by scanning a QR code on a poster at participating businesses. The app then keeps track of where someone has scanned so they know where they have been. You can create QR code posters for your premises using the self-service form on this website.

Home Our response to COVID-19 Government actions --- Section Separator --- The Alert System was introduced by the government in March 2020 to manage and minimise the risk of COVID-19 in New Zealand. The system helps people understand the current level of risk and the restrictions that must be followed. The system helps us to stop the spread of COVID-19, with different measures at each Alert Level. New Zealand is currently at Alert Level 1. The disease is contained in New Zealand, but uncontrolled overseas. This means there are no restrictions to everyday life, but there are controls at the border. Alert System overview Find out about Alert Level 1 Border entry measures are in place to minimise the risk of importing COVID-19 cases. The border is closed, except for New Zealand citizens and residents, and a small number of limited exceptions — such as critical workers. Exemptions are managed by Immigration New Zealand (external link) . Border closures and exceptions (external link) Anyone returning to New Zealand from overseas must complete 14 days in managed-isolation before returning to the community. Arriving back in New Zealand The rest of New Zealand is at Alert Level 1, and there are no restrictions in place for workplaces, schools, domestic travel or events. Keeping COVID-19 out means we need to identify any cases if they emerge. At this stage, our greatest risk of COVID-19 is via our border. Testing is prioritised for people who are most likely to have COVID-19. Let your health professional know if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case. Other people with COVID-19 symptoms may also be tested. This is to help ensure that we don’t have community transmission in New Zealand. Our approach to testing Several visa categories were automatically extended to 25 September 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 and challenge for people returning home. Work, student, visitor, limited or interim visas that expired between 2 April and 9 July 2020 were automatically extended if the person was in New Zealand on 2 April. Confirmation of these extensions and what it means have been emailed to visa holders. Immigration changes due to COVID-19 (external link) All driver licences, WoFs, CoFs and some vehicle certifications that expired on or after 1 January 2020 are valid for up to 6 months from 10 April 2020. This recognises that during Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 3, through no fault of their own, many New Zealanders were unable to keep these documents up to date. This extension allows vehicle users extra time to allow them to get up to date. All vehicle inspection sites are now open and to ensure your vehicle remains safe to use, you should renew your WoF or CoF as soon as possible. NCEA exams were delayed to provide students more time to prepare for end of year assessments. External NCEA examinations and New Zealand Scholarship examinations have moved from 6 November to 16 November, allowing another week for teaching, learning and internal assessment in Term 4. The submission date for subjects which require students to submit a portfolio, such as Design and Visual Communication, has moved from from 28 October to 12 November 2020, giving students more time to prepare. The requirement for NZQA verification of Level 1 and 2 Visual Arts portfolios has been waived, allowing students more time to complete their portfolios and teachers more time for marking.

Information on life at Alert Level 1 --- Section Separator --- Our Alert System guidance does not yet include updated advice on wearing masks. --- Section Separator --- The Alert System was introduced in March 2020 to manage and minimise the risk of COVID-19 in New Zealand. The system helps people understand the current level of risk and the restrictions that must be followed. The measures may be updated on the basis of: new scientific knowledge about COVID-19, and information about the effectiveness of intervention measures in New Zealand and elsewhere. The Alert Levels may be applied at a town, city, territorial local authority, regional or national level. Summary table of the COVID-19 Alert Levels — updated 5 June 2020 [PDF, 1.4 MB] Detailed table of the COVID-19 Alert Levels — updated 5 June 2020 [PDF, 1.7 MB] At all levels, essential services including health services, emergency services, utilities and goods transport will remain up and running. Employers in those sectors must continue to meet their health and safety obligations. At all levels, if there is another emergency, follow normal emergency procedures.

Home Our response to COVID-19 Test and trace COVID-19 symptoms --- Section Separator --- Symptoms include: a cough a high temperature of at least 38°C shortness of breath sore throat sneezing and runny nose temporary loss of smell. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. If you have cold or flu symptoms, you should stay home and call: Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 your doctor, or your iwi health provider. A health professional will advise whether you fit the criteria for testing. Call your doctor before visiting if you have any symptoms. COVID-19 is contained in New Zealand and there is no community transmission. At this stage, our greatest risk of COVID-19 is via our border. Let your health professional know if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case. If you’re outside New Zealand call +64 9 358 5453 or your doctor. If you’re sick, stay home. Don’t go to work or school. Don’t socialise. If you have cold or flu symptoms call your doctor or Healthline and check if you should get tested. Wash your hands. Sneeze and cough into your elbow, and regularly disinfect shared surfaces. If you are told by health authorities to self-isolate you must do so immediately. If you are awaiting test results you must also self-isolate. Information about testing for COVID-19 Like the flu, COVID-19 is spread by droplets from person to person. Good hygiene can prevent its spread. People can catch the virus through their eyes, nose or mouth. The scientific evidence proves that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may spread droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. People may get infected by the virus if they touch those surfaces or objects, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That’s why it’s really important to use good hygiene, at any time. Regularly wash and thoroughly dry your hands Sneeze and cough into your elbow Clean or disinfect shared surfaces regularly If you have cold or flu symptoms, stay home and call your doctor or Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 . --- Section Separator --- Symptoms include: a cough a high temperature of at least 38°C shortness of breath sore throat sneezing and runny nose temporary loss of smell.

Home Our response to COVID-19 Test and trace COVID-19 testing --- Section Separator --- Testing continues to help us eliminate COVID-19 in New Zealand. If you are offered a test for COVID-19, please take it. It will help us ensure we don’t have community transmission, and help keep your friends, family and whānau safe. Testing helps us: identify cases of COVID-19 manage clusters of cases if we find them track how well our efforts are working. The highest priority for testing is to test people who are symptomatic and have: been in contact with a confirmed or probable case travelled internationally in the past 14 days had direct contact with a person who has travelled overseas. This could include Customs, Immigration, and Managed Isolation and Quarantine staff worked on an international aircraft or shipping vessel, or cleaned at an international airport or maritime port in areas visited by international arrivals. Anyone presenting to health services with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be offered testing to help ensure that we don’t have community transmission in New Zealand. However, we particularly encourage you to get tested if you have symptoms and you are: a healthcare worker an aged-care worker Māori Pasifika over 70 years of age, or if you have a pre-existing condition like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease or diabetes. Getting tested early helps protect those around you. If you have cold or flu symptoms, please call: your doctor iwi health provider, or Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 . A health professional will let you know the next steps and whether you should get a test. A COVID-19 test is free of charge. However, you may need to pay for a test if it’s for the purpose of entering another country. If you need to be tested for COVID-19, a sample is taken from you. There’s more than 1 way to take a sample. The most common method is to swab the back of your nose. A swab is like a small cotton-bud but with a longer stick. That sample goes to a lab to be analysed. The lab results may take some time. When you are tested you will be told when and how to expect your results. Whether you test positive or negative, you will be notified about your results. Most people do not need to self-isolate while waiting for a test result — your medical professional will advise you on this. You will only be asked to self-isolate if you: have travelled overseas recently have been in contact with someone who has recently travelled are a close contact of a person with confirmed COVID-19. If you are tested you should follow the advice you’re given about what to do next. If you get tested, we need your help to keep healthcare workers safe. That means continuing to cough and sneeze into your elbow, and staying 2 metres away from other people wherever possible. Follow any instructions you get, like turning up on time, calling ahead or waiting in your car. People testing you may wear protective equipment likes gowns or masks — this is nothing to worry about, it helps protect them and everyone they are testing. Our health system will continue to support anyone who tests positive for COVID-19. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, medical professionals will advise you on what you need to do. For most people, this will mean self-isolating at home, with health staff contacting you daily to check on your health and wellbeing. They will provide any support or advice you may need. Self-isolation Health agencies will identify and contact trace anyone that you have come into close contact with. Contact tracing The health team responsible for your daily health checks will let you know when you are no longer at risk of infecting others with COVID-19. They will assess you as recovered if you meet all the following criteria: It must have been at least 10 days since you got your symptoms. You need to have been clear of all symptoms for 72 hours. If you were hospitalised, it must be at least 10 days after you are discharged from the hospital and you must be clear of all symptoms for 72 hours. If you have had COVID-19 but have not had any symptoms, you will be assessed as recovered when it has been 10 days since you had a positive test. The Ministry of Health is recording testing data by region and by ethnicity within regions. This helps us ensure we have an accurate picture of any future spread of COVID-19 and can respond in the best way. It also helps to keep track of who is being tested, including vulnerable communities or at-risk groups with underlying health conditions.

Home Health and wellbeing Masks --- Section Separator --- The Ministry of Health has updated its advice on the use of masks as part of our ongoing response to COVID-19. Masks can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 when there are cases of community transmission. You don't need to wear a mask at Alert Level 1. But you should have some masks at home, in case we ever need to change Alert Levels. Add some masks to your household emergency kit — make sure you have enough for everyone who usually lives in your household. Retail shops have enough masks in stock in New Zealand for everyone. Most people can use non-medical-grade masks. These masks prevent the wearer from spreading diseases to others and could help protect the wearer from becoming infected. Non-medical-grade masks can be either single-use or reusable. A single-use mask can only be worn once, and you should throw it away after wearing it. Reusable masks can be washed and reused. Non-medical-grade masks do not need to conform to any standard. This means they are not used in medical settings. You can buy non-medical-grade masks online or in shops like pharmacies, supermarkets and hardware stores. You can make your own masks if you wish, but we recommend you buy your masks from a reputable supplier. At Alert Level 2 and higher, people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should use medical-grade masks to help prevent infection. Medical masks are also known as surgical masks. These masks protect the wearer from becoming infected, and from spreading diseases to others. Medical masks form a small part of personal protective equipment (PPE). They are required to conform with Standard AS/NZS 1716:2012 ‘Respiratory protective devices’. They are not reusable. The Ministry of Health will make sure there is enough supply and distribution of medical masks for the wider health sector. Ensuring medical masks are available for health care workers and those working in high-risk COVID-19 settings, such as border control, continues to be a priority. Masks will be most useful when COVID-19 is present in the community and people are in close contact with each other, like at work or in social situations. At Alert Level 1, you do not need to wear masks because there is no evidence of community transmission of COVID-19. At Alert Levels 2 and above the risk of COVID-19 being present in the community is higher. So, wearing a mask becomes more important. If we move to Alert Level 2, you should wear masks in situations where physical distancing is not possible, like on public transport or in shops. At Alert Level 3, masks may become compulsory when physical distancing is not possible. At Alert Level 4, only people delivering or accessing essential services will be moving around, so mask use may be limited. COVID-19 is spread from close contact with a person who has COVID-19. Wearing a mask helps keep you and others safe. A mask helps stop droplets spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. This includes someone who has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. Masks are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. Our strategy to protect New Zealand against COVID-19 is based on our border protections, testing, contact tracing and other public health measures, like washing hands and physical distancing. Masks are an extra protective physical barrier to help keep people safe. When you wear a face mask, it's important you use it safely. This advice applies to both bought and handmade masks.

Home Health and wellbeing Mental wellbeing Looking after your mental wellbeing --- Section Separator --- Everyone’s emotional and mental wellbeing is important. It’s normal to feel anxious or stressed in times of difficulty. However, there are lots of things you can do to feel better. There are a number of things we can all do to boost our mental wellbeing and that of our loved ones. This is important for our wellbeing and helps to make us feel safer, less stressed and less anxious. We can support each other through the recovery, by keeping the connections and close ties to others that we forged during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, worried or scared. Allow yourself time to notice and express what you’re feeling. This could be by writing thoughts and feelings down in a journal, talking to others, doing something creative or practising meditation. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you’re feeling. Reach out to others. Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat at regular times, shower, change your clothes, see others regularly, either virtually or in person, and do your chores. Meditating and exercising can help you to relax and have a positive impact on your thoughts. Try not to increase unhealthy habits like comfort eating, drinking, smoking or vaping. Reaching out to those who may be feeling stressed or concerned can benefit both you and the person receiving support. You may find it useful to limit your time online. Check media and social media at specific times once or twice a day. For support with anxiety, distress or mental wellbeing, you can call or text 1737 to talk with a trained counsellor for free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Staying at home if you’re sick is still the best thing you can do to stop any future spread of COVID-19. Fast and effective contact tracing is 1 way we can all work together to prevent any further spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Washing your hands is 1 of the easiest ways to keep yourself safe. Wash often. Use soap. 20 seconds. Then dry. This kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. It will keep the virus off your hands, so you won’t spread it to other people and make them sick too.

Home Health and wellbeing Stay healthy Clean surfaces --- Section Separator --- Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. The scientific evidence confirms that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. This means that when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. COVID-19 can remain on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to about 3 days, and less than that for other types of surfaces. This will depend on the surface. If surfaces look visibly dirty, they should be cleaned first. It’s best to use a disinfectant. Use a disinfectant that is antiviral and follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely. --- Section Separator --- Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person.

Home Health and wellbeing Stay healthy Wash your hands --- Section Separator --- Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. Follow these steps to wash your hands properly: Wet hands with running water. Apply enough soap to cover wet hands. Scrub all surfaces of the hands — including the back of hands, between fingers and under nails — for at least 20 seconds. Rinse thoroughly with running water. Dry hands with a clean cloth, single-use towel or blow-drier. The same goes for hand sanitiser, use a sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub it into your hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure full coverage. Wash your hands regularly, especially: after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing after visiting a public space, including public transport, markets and places of worship after touching surfaces outside of the home after touching money before, during and after caring for a sick or vulnerable person before and after eating. Always wash your hands: after using the toilet before and after eating after handling rubbish after touching animals and pets after changing babies’ nappies or helping children use the toilet when your hands are visibly dirty. No, you can use any temperature of water to wash your hands. Cold water and warm water both kill germs and viruses — as long as you use soap. Handwashing with soap and water or using hand sanitiser, when done correctly, are both highly effective at killing most germs and viruses. Hand sanitiser is often more convenient when you’re outside of the home, but can be expensive or difficult to find in emergency contexts. You can make handwashing easier for children by setting up a stool so they can reach water and soap by themselves. You can make it fun for them by singing their favourite songs while you help them rub their hands. Germs spread more easily from wet skin than from dry skin, so drying your hands completely is an important step. Paper towels or clean cloths are the most effective way to remove germs without spreading them to other surfaces. --- Section Separator --- Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. --- Section Separator --- Follow these steps to wash your hands properly: Wet hands with running water.

Feeling comfortable in your identity, values and beliefs helps you to feel secure in who you are and what you stand for. When you are content with yourself you are better able to cope with challenges, build strong whānau relationships and discover the things that uplift you. Whānau is about extended relationships — not just your immediate relatives, it’s your friends, hoamahi/colleagues, your community and the people who you care about. Everyone has a place and a role to fulfil within their own whānau, and whānau contributes to your individual wellbeing and identity. Strengthen your taha whānau by staying in touch and keeping the connections and close ties to others that we forged during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Home Travel and the border Border restrictions Managed isolation and quarantine --- Section Separator --- Managed isolation is an important part of our border measures to keep COVID-19 out of New Zealand. While our borders are closed, New Zealand citizens and permanent residents have a legal right to come home. Those returning to New Zealand have a responsibility to do their part to stop COVID-19 spreading in New Zealand by completing 14 days in isolation before safely returning home. Advice if you’re going to travel to New Zealand or want to The purpose of managed isolation is to ensure people do not have COVID-19 before they return to our communities. People are tested around day 3 and day 12 of their stay, and they must test negative before they can leave managed isolation. Tens of thousands of people have completed their managed isolation stay safely, and have returned to their loved ones and friends. New Zealand has managed isolation and quarantine facilities located throughout the country. All facilities are located within hotels. The facilities are closely monitored to make sure that measures are in place to keep New Zealand safe. All hotels selected for managed isolation or quarantine need to meet a strict set of criteria. This is to ensure that people staying and working in them are kept safe and that there’s a safe transition of people back into the community after their isolation period. Some of the criteria hotels must meet include: security and entry/exit points suitable room and bathroom facilities adequate provision of food and drink delivered to rooms safe laundry protocols ability to ensure people's wellbeing through the provision of online access and services. None of the hotels being used for quarantine or managed isolation are currently open to other guests. The Government holds exclusive use of the hotel facilities. List of managed isolation and quarantine facilities and their locations (external link) There are over 500 government and contracted staff directly supporting managed isolation and quarantine. Each quarantine and managed isolation facility has an All-of-Government support team. Staff on the ground at our managed isolation facilities have stood at the frontline of New Zealand’s defence against COVID-19, doing essential work to ensure people can complete their stay safely and comfortably. Each team works alongside facility management to support the health, wellbeing, security, supplementary logistics and administration of the people staying in the facility. Each team has representatives from: Ministry of Health (health and wellbeing) Defence (administration and logistics) Police and Aviation Security (security) Ministry of Social Development (welfare). The size of each team varies slightly based on facility capacity and the extra support required. For example, there are more health professionals at a quarantine facility than a managed isolation facility. The multi-agency teams are responsible for managing the facilities and providing health and wellbeing support, security and assistance to guests, hotel staff and other government agency personnel. --- Section Separator --- Managed isolation is an important part of our border measures to keep COVID-19 out of New Zealand.

The woman absconded from the Pullman Hotel on foot shortly before 6:20pm and was located soon after a couple of blocks away at 8pm on Anzac Avenue. This was excellent work by Police staff who located the woman as quickly as possible . She was located outdoors. The exact movements of the woman are still being determined. Charges are being considered by Police. The woman, who was travelling on her own, arrived in New Zealand from Brisbane, Australia, on 27 June. She had a COVID-19 test on 30 June which returned a negative result. We recognise that managed isolation can be stressful for people who come to it with a variety of circumstances. However, wilfully leaving our facilities cannot and will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will be taken. Every person who arrives in New Zealand must be isolated from other people for a minimum period of 14 days. They must also test negative for COVID-19 before they can go into the community. This 14-day period forms a critical part of the actions being taken to keep New Zealand and New Zealanders safe during a global pandemic when case numbers are constantly increasing overseas. Police are taking all necessary precautions to keep its staff safe. As such, the five Police officers who came into contact with the woman will self-isolate and undergo a COVID-19 test. Further advice will be provided to the officers around self-isolation and testing once we have clarified with certainty the movements and contact throughout the incident.
The Government has confirmed a community-wide trial of CovidCard technology in Rotorua as it explores options for COVID-19 contact tracing. The University of Otago and Nelson Marlborough district health board (DHB) ran a government-funded trial of the CovidCard during lockdown, which found the CovidCard works under controlled conditions. A further trial will be run in Rotorua region, which will involve between 250 and 300 people. It will help us understand how the CovidCard works in a real-world scenario, if it works with our existing contact tracing systems and whether New Zealanders will use it. The Government will also consider whether the CovidCard meets high security and privacy standards, and if it can be used by a wide range of people. --- Section Separator --- Contact tracing is one of the best ways we have to prevent any further spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand, and digital solutions can help make this faster and more effective. No digital solution has been proven to ‘solve’ contact tracing, so the Government is exploring all available options. It is continuing to improve the NZ COVID Tracer app and exploring how it could use Bluetooth technology to increase its effectiveness. It is also investigating the proposed CovidCard. --- Section Separator --- The CovidCard is designed to be worn using a lanyard and record when it comes into ‘close contact’ with another card (within 2 metres for 15 minutes), with this information only held for 21 days. With consent, this information would be given to contact tracers if a cardholder tests positive for COVID-19. CovidCards would be identified by serial numbers and would not store personal details. Cardholder contact details would be stored in a separate database.
The Government has today released the review of the managed isolation and quarantine and outlined the actions that are being taken to respond to issues highlighted by the review. Head of Managed Isolation and Quarantine Air Commodore Darryn Webb says significant changes have already been introduced and work is urgently underway to address other issues raised in the review report. Last week Air Commodore Webb announced a doubling of the on-the-ground Defence Force staff of 32, across 18 facilities. As of today, we have 168 Defence Force personnel across 21 facilities providing 24/7 coverage. There are also more government and defence staff across the end-to-end system. “This increased resourcing has had an immediate impact on the ground in terms of making sure our people are well supported to carry out their roles and ensure the safe transfer of returnees into managed isolation. “The increase in resourcing will form the backbone of further changes that are being made to ensure the system is robust and fit-for-purpose. “We have also increased oversight of the transfer of returnees from aircraft through to managed isolation and quarantine facilities so they are escorted by government staff.” Other improvements rolling out now include: increased security for transferring returnees to managed isolation facilities the standardisation of procedures across all facilities The introduction of better information for returnees — from flight boarding through to entry into New Zealand and their exit from managed isolation. Better information to communities where those facilities are located. Strengthening of demand forecasting, reporting functions and coordination between agencies. Health responses include: more staff in facilities improved model of care — including taking into account issues like mental health and addiction issues more clinical oversight to ensure a consistent quality of service in facilities monitoring to ensure there is consistency across facilities. “All staff supporting this process are performing to a very high standard, and have been doing so over a long period of sustained and increasing pressure. I would like to acknowledge and thank them for their ongoing work and dedication to the job. I am committed to ensuring they have the support and structures that they need to deliver well-functioning managed isolation and quarantine for all New Zealanders,” Air Commodore Webb says. --- Section Separator --- Managed isolation and quarantine: Review terms of reference [PDF, 130 KB] Managed isolation and quarantine: Review report [PDF, 279 KB] Managed isolation and quarantine: Action plan in response to review [PDF, 147 KB] --- Section Separator --- At departure airport.

Latest information on managed isolation charges --- Section Separator --- The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to only charge New Zealanders who enter temporarily, or who leave New Zealand after regulations come into force. Temporary visa holders would have to pay unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand before the border closure, and left before the border closure. --- Section Separator --- The Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to set payment terms, exempt groups of people and waive charges in cases of financial hardship. It will also ensure that: recovered charges do not exceed the actual costs of managed isolation and quarantine no upfront payment would be required there would be flexibility in how people could pay. Check the progress of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill through Parliament (external link) --- Section Separator --- The proposed charging structure for managed isolation and quarantine will be: $3,100 per person in a room $950 for each additional adult, and $475 for each additional child sharing the room. The system has been designed so that it is fair on arrivals and not a barrier for returning to New Zealand, especially for those who might already be experiencing financial stress. It is forecast that more people will be travelling and arriving at the border. The Government has set aside a total of $479 million to pay for the costs of managed isolation facilities until the end of the year. Further details of the charging scheme, and when it will come into force, will be announced soon. --- Section Separator --- Once the regulations come into force, it is proposed New Zealanders, residents and temporary visa holders will have to pay charges: Any New Zealander, who either: leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force, or is visiting New Zealand for less than 90 days. leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force, or is visiting New Zealand for less than 90 days.

Any person travelling to New Zealand to attend the sentencing of the accused in the Christchurch mosque attacks. Refugees and protected persons for their first entry into New Zealand after the charges come into force. Flowchart: Proposed liability for managed isolation and quarantine charges [PDF, 216 KB] --- Section Separator --- New Zealanders who are currently overseas (that is, who left before the regulations come into force) will not have to pay if they stay in New Zealand for 90 days or longer. If you leave New Zealand after the regulations come into force, it is proposed that you would have to pay for your managed isolation unless you qualify for a waiver or are otherwise exempt. Anyone who needs to come home but cannot afford the charges, will still be able to come home. It is proposed that regulations allow the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment to waive charges in full or in part if they consider that undue financial hardship will be caused by the payment of the charges, or in any circumstances (which could include compassionate grounds) for which they consider a full or partial waiver appropriate. This will allow the chief executive to take into consideration an individual’s full circumstances. Final decisions on this will be announced soon. --- Section Separator --- It is impossible to tell how the situation develops internationally and in New Zealand. Our priority is keeping New Zealand safe. The Government is working to make the system sustainable and manageable for as long as we need it and it is expected the system will be amended as appropriate. --- Section Separator --- Our experience from February and March 2020, before managed isolation and quarantine was introduced, showed that compliance with self-isolation requirements by people arriving in New Zealand was patchy and could not be relied on. Final decisions on this will be announced soon.
Thanks to the fast actions of police and Defence Force staff, a person has been caught unlawfully leaving a managed isolation facility in Auckland. About 1pm on 30 July, a 32-year-old left the Crowne Plaza and was caught by police 100 metres away. Defence Force staff verbally challenged the man as he attempted to follow them out a gate, claiming he was a worker. When asked for identification he allegedly refused, and exited onto Albert St. Aviation Security Service (Avsec) and police were immediately alerted, and 2 Defence Force staff followed the man down Albert St, maintaining a safe distance while doing so until a police officer arrived. The officer was wearing a mask and gloves. The man allegedly failed to stop, and was chased for a short distance and apprehended. The man arrived from Brisbane on 29 July, and has not received his COVID-19 testing yet. His day 3 test is scheduled for 1 August. As the returnee has yet to be tested, the police officer who arrested him is following all necessary precautions. The man has been summonsed to appear in court at a later date.
The Bill allowing the Government to recover some costs for managed isolation and quarantine passed its third reading today, and the charges will come into force as soon as regulations are finalised. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill and its supporting regulations will introduce a new charging system for managed isolation to balance the rights of New Zealanders to return home and help reduce pressure on the system. The proposed charges are: $3,100 for the first person in the room $950 for each additional adult sharing the room $475 for each additional child (aged 3 to 17 years) sharing that room. There will be no charge for children under the age of 3. These charges are GST inclusive. Any New Zealander who is currently overseas and enters New Zealand after the regulations come into force for less than 90 days will be liable for charges, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Any New Zealander who leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force (for example for a holiday or business) will be liable for charges when they return, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Everyone entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker will have to pay. In many cases, their employers will pay their managed isolation and quarantine costs. Other temporary visa holders are liable for the charges, unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand at the time the border closed and departed New Zealand on or before 19 March 2020. Charging will start soon after the regulations come into force. This will happen after the Bill is given Royal Assent. The start date of the charging regime will be published on www.miq.govt.nz as soon as it is confirmed. The following exemptions are proposed: Partners, dependent children and legal guardians who are isolating or travelling with someone who is exempt from paying charges, unless they are entering under a critical worker border exception. Someone in New Zealand who goes into managed isolation to care for a person who is exempt from charges. Anyone travelling to New Zealand to attend the sentencing of the person convicted of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Refugees, including claimants, protected persons and applicants under the special immigration category for victims of domestic violence, when they enter New Zealand for the first time. Anyone entering New Zealand after a medical air transfer or rescue at sea. Patients travelling as part of the Ministry of Health High Cost Treatment Pool or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade New Zealand Medical Treatment Scheme. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau who are travelling to New Zealand for medical treatment. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau, travelling from a third country through New Zealand (staying less than 90 days) in order to return to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (staying at least 90 days). People being deported to New Zealand, defined as “returning offenders” (in the Returning Offenders (Management and Information) Act 2015) and any New Zealand citizen deported from Australia. Diplomats and consular staff, including their families, and official government representatives. Waiver applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is proposed that waivers will be available in cases of undue financial hardship and other special circumstances. These special circumstances could include: a New Zealander entering managed isolation because they left New Zealand to accompany a vulnerable or disabled person back to New Zealand someone needing to travel to or from New Zealand to receive medical treatment other compassionate grounds, including when a person has travelled to visit a seriously ill or dying close relative or attend a funeral or tangihanga, whether in New Zealand or overseas. People will be able to apply for waivers once the regulations are in force. Information about the process will be available on www.miq.govt.nz at that time. Returnees who need to pay will get an invoice at the end of their stay in managed isolation and will generally have 90 days to pay. Information about how to pay the fee will be provided on the invoice.
The Ministry of Health has updated its advice on the use of masks as part of our ongoing response to COVID-19. We have seen elsewhere that masks can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 where there are cases of community transmission. We should all now prepare to use masks before there may be a need to use them. You do not need to wear masks at Alert Level 1 — we just need to be prepared. Information and guidance on wearing masks
