Home About our COVID-19 response History of the COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic lights) --- Section Separator --- The COVID-19 Protection Framework replaced Alert Levels in December 2021 and ended in mid-September 2022. It had 3 traffic light settings of Red, Orange and Green. The framework aimed to: help people protect one another from the virus keep hospitalisation rates as low as possible and avoid overwhelming the health system minimise the impact of large outbreaks reduce the need for lockdowns. It also aimed to give people and businesses more stability. At all traffic light settings, essential services continued to operate. This included supermarkets, health services, emergency services, goods transport, and utilities such as power and water supplies. A high vaccination rate remains a key tool to protect people and minimise the spread of COVID-19. Getting vaccinated means you are less likely to get extremely sick or infect other people. Some workplaces may require staff to be vaccinated. Vaccine mandates for government workers ended during 2022. Wearing face masks remains a way to protect ourselves and others. At Red and Orange traffic light settings, there were some places people had to wear face masks, such as on public transport and in supermarkets. At Red, capacity limits applied in some indoor settings. Limits were based on 1-metre distancing, which meant 1 metre square of space for each person, up to the maximum capacity limit. It did not mean everyone had to stay 1 metre apart. Capacity limits did not include workers (paid and unpaid). If an area had very high infection rates, extra restrictions such as local lockdowns or other protective steps may have been used. Examples of protective steps included: stay at home orders closing premises, such as schools or shops limiting numbers allowed at gatherings.

Home COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccine facts and advice Vaccination for children aged 5 to 11 The COVID-19 vaccine protects your child, your whānau and your community. It is free and available now for everyone aged 5 and over. --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 generally has mild effects in children and is rarely severe or fatal. Children who have COVID-19 will commonly have no symptoms or only mild respiratory symptoms, similar to a cold. However, some can become very sick and need to go to hospital. Rare complications can include Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), which may require intensive care. This age group can also suffer long-term side effects (known as long COVID), even after mild cases of COVID-19. Like adults, if your child is infected with COVID-19 they may transmit the virus to other people. Immunising tamariki helps protect whānau members whose health makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

Children and young people who have COVID-19 will commonly have no symptoms or only mild respiratory symptoms, similar to a cold. However, some can become very sick and need to go to hospital. Rare complications can include Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), which may require intensive care. This age group can also suffer long-term side effects (known as long COVID), even after mild cases of COVID-19. COVID-19 symptoms --- Section Separator --- Tamariki aged 5 to 11 receive a children’s (paediatric) version of the Pfizer vaccine, with a lower dose and smaller volume. It is also given using a smaller needle. The lower dose was chosen based on a trial that showed the lower dose was safe and had few side effects in this age group. Children are not eligible for a booster. To be fully protected, children need 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. It is recommended the first and second dose are at least 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 21 days if needed — for example, if the child is starting significant immunosuppression treatment. You will need to discuss this with the child's doctor. --- Section Separator --- If children and young people who have been vaccinated do develop COVID-19, they are far less likely to fall seriously ill and less likely to transmit the virus to others. For children aged 5 to 11, clinical trial results showed the Pfizer vaccine was 90.7% effective against getting COVID-19 symptoms, and no participants developed severe COVID-19. Dr Lily Fraser — effects of COVID-19 on tamariki Dr Jin Russell — How safe is the vaccination for tamariki? --- Section Separator --- Medsafe is responsible for approving the use of all medicines and vaccines in New Zealand. They only approve a vaccine in Aotearoa once they are satisfied it has met strict standards for safety, efficacy and quality. The trials in 5 to 11-year-olds with a child dose of the Pfizer showed the vaccine was safe, and the side effects were generally mild. COVID-19 vaccines used in New Zealand Research and data on vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 | Ministry of Health (external link) --- Section Separator --- Explain that it might hurt for a short time, just like their other childhood immunisations. Tell them there will be a small needle and that they will feel a sharp scratch or sting briefly but then it will be over. They may have a sore arm, fever, headache or feel tired afterwards. It is important to tell them why they are getting vaccinated. Let them know the vaccine will protect them against COVID-19, and protect their family, their grandparents, their community, and other kids at school who may be more at risk from COVID-19 if they catch it. Make sure they know they will need 2 doses. Give them time to ask the vaccinator questions if they have them. Have some games or toys ready so you can distract them during their vaccination and entertain them while you wait for 15 minutes afterwards. Arrange a fun activity or treat to look forward to after the appointment. Tell them that they might feel a bit unwell or a day or two, and arrange to spend some extra time with them if you can.

Home COVID-19 vaccines Side effects --- Section Separator --- Like all medicines, you might experience some mild side effects in the days after getting your vaccination. This is common, and a sign that your body is learning to fight the virus. Most side effects do not last long, and will not stop you from having a second dose or going about your daily life. Some side effects may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machinery. The most common reported reactions are: pain or swelling at the injection site feeling tired or fatigued headache muscle aches chills joint pain fever redness at the injection site nausea. Some side effects are more common after the second dose. Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are similar in young people to those seen in adults. You can: place a cold, wet cloth or ice pack on the injection site for a short time rest and drink plenty of fluids take paracetamol or ibuprofen. Some side effects are more serious but rare, such as a severe allergic reaction. Serious allergic reactions or anaphylaxis from the vaccine are rare. This is why people are watched for around 15 minutes post-vaccination. Vaccinators are well trained in managing these if they occur. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the tissue forming a sac around the heart. These conditions are usually caused by viral infections including COVID-19, but they are also very rare and serious side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis linked to the vaccine generally appear within a few days, and mostly within the first few weeks after having the vaccine. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include: tightness, heaviness, discomfort or pain in your chest or neck difficulty breathing or catching your breath feeling faint or dizzy or light-headed fluttering, racing or pounding heart, or feeling like it is 'skipping beats'. If you get any of these symptoms after your Pfizer or Novavax vaccination, promptly get medical help — for example from your doctor or after-hours medical service. You will not have to pay for this. You can also call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 at any time to get advice. If you need urgent medical help, call 111 . Tell them you have had a COVID-19 vaccination so they can assess you properly. Also tell them if you have COVID-19, or have had it. Children are less likely to have these side effects but may not tell you about the symptoms. We recommend you ask your child how they feel after being vaccinated. A rare but serious side effect is a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). These reactions usually happen soon after your vaccination, which is why you need to wait at least 15 minutes. If you do have a serious allergic reaction, vaccinators are trained to help. COVID-19: Vaccine side effects and reactions | Ministry of Health (external link) It is recommended you do not have Novavax if you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or to any component of the vaccine.

Home Current phase of our COVID-19 response New Zealand’s COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic lights) has ended. With case numbers low, most COVID-19 rules were removed on 13 September 2022. What you need to know New rules for Household Contacts Get free RATs Face masks International travel changes If you have COVID-19 Antivirals --- Section Separator --- Protecting lives and livelihoods remains the goal of the Government’s COVID-19 response. It is now possible to do this with fewer requirements, giving greater certainty to people, businesses and communities. With case numbers falling, a highly vaccinated population, and increased access to antiviral medicines to treat COVID-19, public health experts say it is safe to remove most COVID-19 rules and end border restrictions. Thanks to the efforts of New Zealanders throughout the pandemic, we have saved thousands of lives. As well as each person and family who has followed the rules, we thank iwi and Māori health providers, Pacific organisations, aged care providers, businesses, schools and other education providers who have made extraordinary efforts to protect people and communities. Isolation is our main tool to manage the spread of the virus. It is the most effective way to keep case numbers low. Isolating for 7 days remains a requirement for everyone who tests positive. To monitor for new variants arriving from overseas, the Government will continue to use: follow-up PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests and genome sequencing of positive cases in travellers targeted surveillance at the border.

Displaying 1-10 of 1071 updates 13 Oct 2022 The Omicron subvariant BQ1.1 has been circulating in the Northern Hemisphere and has now been found in New Zealand. 30 Sep 2022 An analysis of deaths from COVID-19 in New Zealand shows being up to date with your vaccines is the single best way to reduce the risk of dying from COVID-19. 21 Sep 2022 Watch the latest update on our response to COVID-19. 15 Sep 2022 The Ministry of Health has released long COVID guidelines for health professionals, individuals and those caring for people with long COVID. 13 Sep 2022 Read today's update on COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health. 12 Sep 2022 Watch the latest update on our response to COVID-19. 12 Sep 2022 The most recent health advice now tells us that with the lowest cases and hospitalisations since February, we are in a good position to move forward. 09 Sep 2022 Read today's update on COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health. 09 Sep 2022 Read today's update on COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health. 08 Sep 2022 Read today's update on COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health.
Public Health Agency Deputy Director-General Dr Andrew Old says thanks to lower levels of community transmission early in the pandemic and high vaccination rates, New Zealand has had a lower rate of deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic compared to many countries. Most people that test positive for COVID-19 will experience a mild to moderate illness and be able to self-care at home before making a full recovery. ‘But sadly, despite that, more than 2000 people have died from COVID-19, either as an underlying or contributing cause, and we remain committed to ensuring those most at risk of death from COVID-19 are prioritised in our response.’ As part of this, Te Manatū Hauora Ministry of Health has examined COVID-19 attributed deaths to better identify greatest risk factors for COVID-19 and help establish how these risks can be reduced. This analysis is available on the Ministry’s website: COVID-19 Mortality in Aotearoa New Zealand: Inequities in Risk | Ministry of Health (external link) The analysis examined 1,797 COVID-19 deaths between 1 January and 26 August 2022, which had been attributed to COVID-19. This included: 1,458 people of European or Other ethnicity 158 Māori 111 Pacific people 60 people of Asian ethnicity. It supports that, as well as age being a strong risk for death from COVID-19, there is an excess risk for Māori and Pacific Peoples, people who are unvaccinated, those in higher deprivation and those with pre-existing health conditions. The analysis found: Age is the single biggest determinant in the risk of death from COVID-19. Vaccination is one of the most effective steps people can take to reduce their risk of death from COVID-19. The analysis shows a 62% reduction in the risk of death from COVID-19 among people who had two or more doses compared to those who had received one dose or no doses. There is evidence that boosters further reduce the risk of death from COVID-19, and this will be the subject of future study. There was an increased risk of death from COVID-19 for Māori and Pacific People, who were respectively at 2.0 and 2.5 times greater risk compared to the European or Other group. While the risks of death were much lower for all groups under-60 than for older age groups, the inequity for Māori and Pacific people was more pronounced among under-60s, with the risk of death 3.7 and 2.9 times higher respectively. Of the 78 people under 60 who died from COVID-19, 35 were European and Other, 24 were Māori, 13 were Pacific People, and six were Asian people. There is increased risk for those in socio-economically deprived groups, with the most deprived 20% of New Zealanders having three times the risk when compared to the least deprived 20%. 429 COVID attributed deaths were people among the most deprived 20% of New Zealanders and 153 were people among the least deprived 20% of New Zealanders. Having one or more pre-existing health condition was also a substantial factor in an increased mortality risk., especially for people under 60, associated with a 6.3 higher risk of death from COVID-19 compared to someone with no pre-existing health conditions. The analysis showed that of the 78 people under-60 whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19, 72 had a pre-existing health condition. ‘This analysis shows that being up to date with your vaccinations not only helps protect yourself and your loved ones from severe disease, but it could save your life.’ However, it also shows the burden of COVID-19 has fallen unevenly across New Zealand. Some of this excess risk for Māori and Pacific people can be explained by higher rates of socio-economic deprivation, pre-existing conditions, and lower vaccination rates. Inequities in vaccination rates alone accounted for around a quarter of the excess risk for Māori and Pacific peoples. However, even controlling for these factors, the analysis shows Māori and Pacific people are still at a significantly higher risk of death from COVID-19. ‘Unfortunately, this does reflect broader long-standing health inequities for Māori and Pacific, with poorer health access and outcomes across many measures. It is also similar to COVID-19 experience in many countries, including Australia, the United States and United Kingdom, where already vulnerable communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.’ ‘These findings are not unexpected and our COVID-19 response throughout has been informed by understanding that the communities with the poorest health are also the most at risk from COVID-19.' Protecting Māori and Pacific people is an integral part of the ongoing COVID-19 response. The Ministry has always taken a collaborative and comprehensive approach, engaging at multiple levels to support Māori and Pacific communities to stay safe. We continue to do this because we recognise the ongoing, intergenerational and inequitable vulnerability of these communities. Te Manatū Hauora, Te Whatu Ora, and Te Aka Whai Ora will continue to engage with Māori through the National Iwi Chairs Forum, Māori health providers, community groups, and other organisations to inform the overall COVID-19 response, and ensure it promotes equitable outcomes for Māori. Steps being taken to better protect vulnerable groups as part of the COVID-19 response include: Health districts and Māori and Pacific providers are providing tailored outreach services, such as the provision of after-hours, weekend services and an increased number of vaccination sites, such as pharmacies, and pop-up clinics in community locations including marae and places of worship. The delivery of multiple vaccines at diverse vaccination sites is happening through a whānau-centred approach in partnership with health districts, Māori, and Pacific health providers. The vaccinator workforce is being expanded to build localised and culturally competent capacity to administer vaccines to people aged 5 and up. This will support relationship building at the local level and removes barriers for whanau accessing services. The Government has recently expanded access at a lower age of antiviral medicines and Pharmac has secured agreements to purchase 40,000 more antiviral medicine courses. Anyone over 65, Māori and Pacific people over 50, or anyone who meets Pharmac’s requirements, can now access these treatments in the early stages after contracting the virus. There is work underway by all three health agencies – Manatū Hauora, Te Whatu Ora, and Te Aka Whai Ora – to encourage more eligible Māori and Pacific people to get their first booster. We are continuing with our targeted support to 10 communities around the country where vaccination rates are comparatively low.

The COVID-19 Protection Framework, also known as the traffic light system, will be removed from 11:59pm tonight, Monday 12 September, so all New Zealanders can continue to move forward with certainty. It is time to safely turn the page on our COVID-19 management, and live without the extraordinary measures we have previously used. Today marks a milestone in our response. Finally, rather than feeling that COVID dictates what happens to us, our lives, and our futures, we take back control. For the first time in 2 years we can approach summer with the much-needed certainty New Zealanders and business need, helping to drive greater economic activity critical to our economic recovery. The COVID-19 Protection Framework ends at 11:59pm Monday 12 September. All mask-wearing requirements removed, except in healthcare and aged care facilities. Only people who test positive with COVID-19 need to isolate for 7 days. Household Contacts no longer need to. All Government vaccine mandates will end in 2 weeks on 26 September. Removal of all vaccination requirements for incoming travellers and aircrew. Support for business and workers to continue through leave support payments All New Zealanders aged 65 and over, and Māori and Pacific peoples aged 50 and over, to have automatic access to COVID antivirals if they test positive The most recent health advice now tells us that with the lowest cases and hospitalisations since February, our population well vaccinated, and expanded access to antiviral medicines, New Zealand is in a position to move forward. You will no longer be required by Government to wear a mask anywhere, except in healthcare settings like hospitals, GPs and aged residential care facilities. Some places, such as workplaces, special events, or marae may ask you to wear a mask, but this will be at their discretion and no longer a Government requirement. Please respect those who choose to keep wearing masks as a form of protection. All remaining Government vaccine mandates will end in 2 weeks on 26 September. It will now be an employer’s discretion as to whether they require their workforce to be vaccinated. Vaccination requirements for all travellers arriving into New Zealand including aircrew also ends, and the requirement to test on day 0/1 and 5/6 will now just be encouraged. Our 7-day isolation period for COVID cases will remain. However, the 7-day isolation period will now only be required for those who test positive for COVID-19. Their Household Contacts will only be asked to undertake a daily rapid antigen test  (RAT) test before going about their life as normal. In short, we now move on to a simple 2 requirements system of masks in healthcare settings and 7 days isolation for positive cases only. The Government has also made an additional purchase of 40,000 more antiviral medicine courses, expected to enter New Zealand in the next few days. We are giving greater access to antiviral medicines for New Zealanders, and have secured agreements that provide a significant boost to our supply for the long term. So now, anyone over the age of 65, and Māori and Pacific people over the age of 50, or anyone who meets Pharmac requirements, can access the treatment in the early stages of contracting the virus. This means more than double the number of New Zealanders will be able to access these medicines if they need them than previously. There is no question – thousands of lives have been saved by the efforts of Kiwis. Be it iwi and Māori health providers, Pacifica organisations, aged care providers, businesses or the sacrifices of New Zealanders separated from loved ones, everyone played a part. From Tuesday we will now move to weekly COVID-19 reporting, similar to Australia. The current rolling 7-day average of hospitalisations is 241, the lowest since February and down from 273 this time last week. There are 225 current hospitalisations. There have been a total of 1,950 deaths — a 7-day rolling average of 5. People visiting the following healthcare settings will be required to wear a mask: primary care urgent care hospitals pharmacies aged residential care disability-related residential care. The requirement excludes counselling, mental health and addiction services. Wearing a face mask
Through the course of managing Omicron, we will be taking a phased approach. As case numbers grow, both testing and isolation approaches will change in response. Other countries have had to adapt their response in the middle of widespread outbreaks. We are setting out the changes ahead of large case numbers to give people a clearer idea of what to expect and what they need to do at each phase. Almost no country in the world has escaped Omicron and New Zealand is no exception. But where we can be an exception is how well we minimise the impact of the virus and protect our people from it. Vaccination remains our most effective weapon against the virus. The Omicron variant is markedly less severe than prior variants. One US report suggests the hospitalisation rate is 10 times less than the Delta variant. Its transmission and severity is also reduced by vaccination. So far, we have been focused on keeping Omicron out of the community for as long as possible while we roll out vaccinations to children and boosters for our adult population. Now that it is here, we expect case numbers to grow rapidly and put our health system under considerable pressure. Here are the three phases for Omicron: --- Section Separator --- Phase One is where we are now, and we are doing what we have successfully done with Delta — taking a ‘stamp it out’ approach. Broadly speaking, that includes the same contact tracing, isolation, and request that everyone who is symptomatic be tested at a community testing station or at a primary health provider. If you are required to isolate, you will receive advice and — if needed — support to do so. At this phase you will need to isolate for 14 days if you are a case, and 10 days if you are contact. Our objective is to keep cases as low as possible for as long as possible to allow people to be boosted and children to be vaccinated without Omicron being widespread. --- Section Separator --- In Phase Two, our objective is to slow the spread and protect our vulnerable communities. The system will be adjusted to focus much more on identifying those who are at greater risk of severe illness from Omicron — which will be a smaller percentage of cases. In Phase Two, we will reduce the isolation period for cases to 10 days and contacts to 7 days in line with best practice overseas. Household contacts will actively be managed by contact tracing services, with close contacts requiring a PCR test on day 5. A rapid escalation in case numbers and the resulting pressure on our resources will also require us to shift from identifying all infected individuals to being more targeted to those most at risk and those needed to keep the country going. Digital technology is used more in this phase. Cases will be notified via text message and be directed to an online self-investigation tool which will focus on high-risk exposures. Information will be provided via email and phone-based interviews will still take place where it’s required. Other forms of support will be available to those who need it. We will also change our current testing requirements for critical workers who are close contacts of cases. The prime focus of testing and tracing will be protecting this workforce and those most vulnerable to becoming severely unwell. Phase Two is where we will see more widespread use of the test to return-to-work policy where asymptomatic contacts in critical workforces can return a negative rapid antigen test in order to go to work. We will continue to manage testing of symptomatic people and Close Contacts with PCR testing but we will be enabling ‘test to return’ for asymptomatic critical workers who are close contacts of cases using rapid antigen tests (RATs). These are people like our healthcare workers and those working in food supply and infrastructure who are key to our response to COVID-19 and also in ensuring New Zealanders can continue to access the services they need. RATs will be integrated into our testing system at this phase and will work alongside PCR tests. They will be useful when the laboratories cannot provide PCR results within a useful time frame because of large volumes or because of transport delays. --- Section Separator --- At Phase Three, when cases are in the thousands, we will make further changes to contact tracing. The definition of contacts will change to household and household like contacts only. This will mean the highest risk contacts will need to isolate. Supported self-service, rapid antigen testing for diagnosing COVID-19 and a self-service tool to enable identification of high-risk contacts will be significant to respond to the high volumes of Omicron cases. Digital technologies will continue to be utilised at this phase, and people will be supported to self-notify Close Contacts. There will be continued support for those members of our community who are not digitally enabled. The majority of people will be supported and be able to self-manage and isolate at home; and clinical care will focus on anyone with high needs. Clinical care and welfare support will be targeted based on need. Through the course of Phase Two and Three, we have a test to return regime that will apply to our critical workforces, to keep them going through the outbreak. Our plan is simple — get boosted, wear a mask, follow basic hygiene rules we’ve become so familiar with and reduce contact as much as is practical. We have slowed the virus from entering the community and given households and businesses time to prepare. As always, it’s what each and everyone one of us can do as individuals that will make a difference. Omicron is now in more than 80 countries around the world. By delaying its arrival here we’ve had the time to kick off boosters, vaccinations for children, and prepare. I encourage everyone to use the coming days to take steps at home and with your family, neighbours and community to make a plan. Resources to help you do this are on the Unite Against Covid-19 website. Be prepared for COVID-19
These guidelines are intended to provide clinical guidance on long COVID conditions in both children and adults in Aotearoa New Zealand. The guidelines are primarily for primary care practitioners, community and hospital clinicians, and will also be useful for individuals who have adults and children in their whānau with long COVID. “We know how COVID-19 has affected a large proportion of New Zealanders since the pandemic began in 2020,” says the Ministry’s Chief Allied Health Professions Officer Dr Martin Chadwick. “We are continuing to learn more about the effects of long COVID and these guidelines add to the information and resources we and other health agencies have been developing and making available for use since the beginning of the pandemic.” The guidelines: look at the options for care available to people with the condition give advice to health professionals on what to look for when diagnosing long COVID highlight resources available for people to manage long COVID symptoms. Long COVID factsheet for individuals and whānau [PDF, 205 KB] “We have had input, while creating these guidelines, from health professionals around the country in a number of fields, including researchers and people who’ve experienced COVID-19 and long COVID,” says Dr Chadwick. “It’s been important to gather all this expertise together to produce guidelines which will, we hope, be a useful tool for health professionals and people who have experienced these conditions and continue to live with them today. “In the meantime, we’ve been continuing to monitor the global and domestic situation, adding resources to our website and making available resources for primary care, allied health and nursing professionals. “As Chief Allied Health Professions Officer, I’ve also been regularly involved in webinars and other sessions to talk about long COVID to clinicians around the country, based on our research, evidence and experience to date. “We know COVID has been evolving, so too has long COVID. And because of that, these guidelines will evolve too. We will ensure they are updated when they need to be and will continue to reflect best practice. We will also continue to this make this material more accessible for all sectors of the population,” says Dr Chadwick. Long COVID guidelines | Ministry of Health (external link)
The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) has confirmed it has sequenced New Zealand’s first case of Omicron subvariant BQ.1.1 in a person who tested positive for COVID-19. BQ1.1 was also detected in Te Waipounamu wastewater samples. The list of new subvariants appearing within New Zealand is lengthy and growing. Many of these new subvariants are identified by their mutations, many of which are shared across several subvariants, but it can take weeks or months to determine whether these mutations will allow a subvariant to out-compete others circulating in the community. At the early stage of a new variant being identified in New Zealand, it is difficult to predict whether and when it will become established in the community. So far, most Omicron variants have not demonstrated a change in severity of the disease. Early evidence overseas suggests the BQ.1.1 has a growth advantage relative to BA.5, the dominant variant currently circulating in New Zealand. In recent weeks in the Northern Hemisphere the colder weather, waning immunity, timing of last vaccinations and other behavioural factors, are likely to have contributed to an increase in BQ.1.1 cases. Evidence is still evolving as to how BQ.1.1 would compete against BA.5 in a New Zealand context and whether this could affect the level of COVID-19 circulating in the community in the coming months. Relative to many other parts of the world, New Zealand currently has a high level of immunity based on high vaccine uptake and widespread relatively recent infection predominantly with BA.2 and BA.4/5 variants. Vaccines are still expected to provide robust protection against severe disease, particularly in those who have received boosters. We encourage people to get their vaccine and booster doses when they fall due. The recent increase in cases nationally falls within our expected modelling of a slow rise in cases from now to the end of the year, although this may still change. We would expect regions to experience increases and decreases in COVID-19 cases at different times depending on a range of conditions. Local factors that could impact case numbers include levels of immunity in the community related to immunisation, previous infections, large events and indoor gatherings. At this stage, there is no evidence that BQ.1.1 is driving an increase in cases but Manatū Hauora — the Ministry of Health, and Te Whatu Ora — Health New Zealand, alongside ESR, are closely monitoring the development of COVID-19 subvariants overseas and in New Zealand, including BQ.1.1. The Ministry of Health carries out regular COVID-19 public health assessments and updates its advice to Government on appropriate public health measures based on the latest evidence. The next update on cases, hospitalisations, deaths and trends analysis will be published by the Ministry of Health on Monday 17 October.

Home Prepare and stay safe About COVID-19 COVID-19 symptoms --- Section Separator --- Symptoms can include one or more of the following: a new or worsening cough sneezing and runny nose a fever temporary loss of smell or altered sense of taste sore throat shortness of breath fatigue/feeling of tiredness. Less common symptoms may include: diarrhoea headache muscle pain or body aches nausea vomiting malaise — a general feeling of discomfort, illness or unease chest pain abdominal pain joint pain confusion or irritability. These less common symptoms almost always occur with one or more of the common symptoms. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are like other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline on 0800 358 5453 or your iwi health provider. If you get symptoms with Omicron, you are likely to get them within 3 days of infection. But it could take up to 8 days after infection. Sometimes people may have COVID-19, but not have any symptoms. Some people with COVID-19 can pass it on to others 1 or 2 days before showing symptoms. If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, get a test as soon as you start to feel unwell. Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can get the help you need as early as possible. Call: your doctor or nurse Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 your iwi health provider, or a community-based testing location if you are outside New Zealand, call +64 9 358 5453 or your doctor. How to get a COVID-19 test While you have symptoms: Stay home. Do not go to work or school. Do not socialise. Wash your hands often. Sneeze and cough into your elbow, and disinfect shared surfaces often. If health authorities tell you to self-isolate, do so immediately. If you are waiting for test results you will also need to self-isolate. If you have COVID-19 Some people who have tested positive for COVID-19 can still be infectious after 7 days. If you are still sick at the end of your self-isolation period, stay home until you are well and for 24 hours after you no longer have symptoms. You will not have to pay for any COVID-19 related medical costs. COVID-19 healthcare is free for up to 6 weeks from the first day of your symptoms or the day you test positive, whichever is earlier. This includes 1 follow-up check with your healthcare provider if required during those 6 weeks, once your acute episode of COVID-19 is over. After you have had the follow-up check, if you require one, and you no longer have acute COVID-19, you will then need to pay for your future visits to your doctor and prescription dispensing fees, just as you would for other medical conditions, even if it is within the 6-week period. If you get COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 28 days or fewer since a previous infection (either from when you tested positive or you first had symptoms) and: you are low risk, you do not need to take another test — stay home and recover, until 24 hours after you no longer have symptoms you have an underlying health condition or have COVID-19-like symptoms that are getting worse, you should seek advice from a health practitioner or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . If you have COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 29 days or more since a previous infection, you should take a RAT. If it is positive, you must self-isolate and follow the same advice as for your first infection. Get a COVID-19 test If you have COVID-19 COVID-19 is spread from person to person. When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs, sneezes or sings, they may spread particles containing the virus. These particles range in size. Larger and heavier particles — droplets — quickly fall to the ground or other surfaces within seconds or minutes. Smaller particles — aerosols — can remain airborne for minutes to hours. COVID-19 is mostly spread by aerosols, which is why air ventilation is important. Getting COVID-19 off a surface is less common, but it is still important to clean surfaces to reduce the risk. The risk of airborne transmission becomes higher: in enclosed spaces that do not have good airflow in crowded places with many people nearby in close-contact settings, such as close-range conversations, singing, or shouting. The risk is lower outside, with fewer people, and if people are widely spread. Long COVID describes the symptoms that continue or develop after the initial COVID-19 symptoms. This is usually longer than 12 weeks after a person is first infected. Most people who get COVID-19 recover from the acute signs and symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks. And they should be back to all activities they were doing before COVID-19 by 12 weeks. However, some people report a range of symptoms beyond the standard time of recovery. Symptoms of long COVID can persist for weeks or sometimes months. They can include: fatigue breathlessness cough sore throat chest tightness chest pain difficulty concentrating, cognitive impairment or 'brain fog' difficulty sleeping pins and needles dizziness joint pain muscle pain. For support with the management and treatment of long COVID, seek help from your doctor or healthcare team. COVID-19 healthcare is fully funded for up to 6 weeks from the first day of your symptoms or the day you test positive, whichever is earlier. You can find more information about long COVID, including more commonly reported symptoms, on the Ministry of Health website: Long COVID | Ministry of Health (external link) Healthy habits can slow the spread of the virus and help protect you, your whānau, and your community from COVID-19. Healthy habits include handwashing and wearing a face mask in crowded indoor places. Healthy habits Getting vaccinated means if you have COVID-19, you are far less likely to: get very sick need to go to hospital infect other people. While a 2-dose course provides some protection against severe disease from Omicron, this protection can decrease over time.

Home Prepare and stay safe About COVID-19 What is COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It affects your lungs, airways and other organs. Coronaviruses are a large and diverse family of viruses that cause illnesses such as the common cold. Other recent diseases caused by coronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS-CoV-2 was first recognised in China and likely originated in animals. It is still unclear how the virus came to infect humans. The disease spread to other countries, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus has since undergone genetic mutations over time as it adapts to humans. Some of these mutations can spread more easily than the original virus. It is a natural process for viruses to change or mutate, which may produce variants. Variants are developing around the world. This tends to happen in places where the virus is out of control. WHO is tracking variants of concern and variants of interest. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants | World Health Organization (external link) Variants of COVID-19 may affect how fast the virus spreads, or how sick people get from the virus. The Ministry of Health provides updates on variants and has a framework to prepare and respond to any new variants of concern. COVID-19 variants | Ministry of Health (external link) Omicron was first classified as a variant of concern by WHO in November 2021. It has spread worldwide and is now the major variant in many countries. Compared to Delta, Omicron: is more infectious causes similar symptoms, but because we have a highly vaccinated population, many people have milder or no symptoms (though could still pass the virus on to others) puts many more people in hospital, because Omicron can cause many more infections over a short period of time can still cause severe illness and even death, especially in people at high risk of serious illness, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions. Omicron, like other variants, continues to change. Variants and sub-variants in New Zealand include: BA.2 — dominant in early 2022 BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 — first detected in New Zealand in late April 2022 BA.2.75 — first detected in New Zealand in July 2022, may be slightly more infectious than BA.2. Although new variants of Omicron continue to emerge, there does not appear to have been a change in the severity of COVID-19. New Zealand's public health settings to manage current Omicron variants are appropriate for its subvariants. Omicron variants | Ministry of Health (external link) To identify which variant a person has, there needs to be whole-genome sequencing from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We encourage people arriving from overseas to do rapid antigen tests (RATs). Those who test positive should have a follow-up PCR test to identify the variant. COVID-19 is spread from person to person. When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs, sneezes or sings, they may spread particles containing the virus. These particles range in size.

Booster doses reduce the chance of serious illness and lower the risk of spreading COVID-19 to others. Get your vaccine booster The symptoms of COVID-19 are like common illnesses such as the cold or flu. Some people will only experience mild to moderate symptoms. Older people, ethnic minorities, and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from the virus. Some people who have had the virus suffer health impacts longer than a few weeks or months. This is commonly referred to as Long COVID. Symptoms of COVID-19 and Long COVID People at higher risk of COVID-19 People at higher risk of serious illness can get antiviral medicines. When taken early on in your COVID-19 illness, antivirals can help you get better faster and stay out of hospital. Medicines to treat COVID-19 With case numbers falling, a highly vaccinated population, and increased access to antiviral medicines to treat COVID-19, it is safe to remove most COVID-19 rules and end border restrictions. Protecting lives and livelihoods remains the goal of the Government’s COVID-19 response. The next phase of our COVID-19 response High rates of vaccination is our main tool to protect people and minimise the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine is free and available to everyone in New Zealand aged 5 and over. COVID-19 vaccines Wastewater testing helps monitor COVID-19 in New Zealand. It is a surveillance tool alongside testing community and border cases. COVID-19 wastewater testing | Ministry of Health (external link) The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) tests wastewater around the country. An interactive dashboard shares ESR’s wastewater science. It can help you track potential COVID-19 risk in your area. Wastewater testing results | Institute of Environmental Science and Research (external link) To monitor for new variants arriving from overseas, the Government uses: follow-up PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests and genome sequencing of positive cases in travellers targeted surveillance at the border. --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Home Prepare and stay safe Healthy habits COVID-19 is in the community. To slow the spread and continue to protect yourself, your whānau, and your community, it is important to keep up the healthy habits we know. --- Section Separator --- Everyone in in Aotearoa New Zealand aged 5 and over can get their free COVID-19 vaccination now. You can get a booster if it has been at least 3 months since your second dose. Vaccination remains one of the best tools in the fight against COVID-19. Even if you have had COVID-19, getting a booster once enough time has passed gives you another a layer of protection from the virus. Being up-to-date with your COVID-19 vaccinations also helps protect people who are more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus and people who cannot be vaccinated such as babies and children under 5 years old. COVID-19 vaccines --- Section Separator --- If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms you should get a test as soon as you start to feel unwell. Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can get the help you need as early as possible. Call your doctor or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice about getting tested. COVID-19 symptoms How to get a COVID-19 test --- Section Separator --- Face masks can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. They are useful in poorly ventilated indoor areas and when you are around people you do not know. They stop particles spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. This is particularly useful when someone has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. You must wear one when visiting healthcare services. Wearing a face mask --- Section Separator --- Good ventilation helps remove COVID-19 virus particles in the air. We encourage you to let in fresh air every day, including after someone visits your home. If you can, partly open a window about 5cm for most of the day. Or open windows for at least 15 minutes as often as possible, whenever it is practical to do so. If your windows do not open, check if your ventilation system filters (cleans) the air. Ventilation and COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- Cough or sneeze into your elbow or cover your mouth and nose with tissues. Put tissues in a bin immediately, then wash your hands thoroughly. This will catch the droplets and keep the virus off your hands, so you will not spread it to other people and make them sick too. --- Section Separator --- Washing your hands is one of the easiest ways to keep yourself safe. Wash often with soap for 20 seconds. Then dry your hands completely. This kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. You should wash your hands if you have been in a public place, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching your face, including your eyes, nose or mouth, if your hands are not clean. Using hand sanitiser is also effective at killing germs and viruses. It destroys the protective bubble of the virus, but only if the sanitiser has at least 60% alcohol. Sanitiser is also effective in reducing the number and type of germs on your hands. --- Section Separator --- Clean surfaces regularly. This includes frequently touched items like door handles, light switches and phones. When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they may spread particles containing the virus. These particles range in size. The larger and heavier particles or droplets can settle on surrounding surfaces. Use an antiviral disinfectant and follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely. --- Section Separator --- You are not required to maintain physical distance from others. But it is still worthwhile keeping a safe distance from people you do not know while out and about. This will help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community. --- Section Separator --- As Omicron is now widespread, we no longer need to contact trace individual cases. This means you do not need to keep a record of where you have been for contact tracing purposes. In case you do test positive for COVID-19, it is still a good idea to: keep track of people you have been with record any high-risk locations you have visited, for example hospitals or aged care facilities keep Bluetooth tracing turned on. We encourage you to not remove the NZ COVID Tracer app from your phone just yet. Bluetooth tracing is still being used to notify people if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Bluetooth tracing | Ministry of Health (external link) The contact tracing system may need to return if another variant of concern arrives in New Zealand. Keep track of where you have been

To enhance filtration of your face mask, you can swap the inner layer to use spunbond. Cut out a rectangle from the moisture-resistant fabric for the outer layer, measuring 19.5 cm x 19 cm. Cut 2 pieces of elastic, each measuring 20 cm long. Take the outer piece of fabric, with the side you want facing outwards turned up. Pin the ends of the elastic to the sides of your fabric. Make a semi-circle with your elastic so it does not catch when you sew it. Pin the elastic in place. Lay your pieces of fabric together (with the spunbond in the middle, if using). Make sure the moisture-resistant fabric that will be on the outside of your face mask is turned inwards here. Pin all the pieces together. Stitch your fabric together with a 6 mm seam allowance. Leave a small opening on one side. Turn the fabric right side out and sew a 3 mm seam around the outside to close the opening and finish the edges neatly. Make 3 evenly spaced folds along the right and left sides of your face covering. Pin these in place. To complete your face covering, stitch across the pleats, 3 mm away from your first line of stitching. Wash your face mask in hot water and detergent, either by hand or in a washing machine.

Home Prepare and stay safe Healthy habits Face masks Types of face masks --- Section Separator --- Wearing a face mask helps keep you and others safe. They are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. To be effective, a face mask should: go over your nose, mouth and chin be well-fitting so there are no gaps above, below or on the sides be used correctly and consistently not be damp, damaged or dirty. A face mask that is not fitted correctly may become ineffective. It may not offer enough protection for you or those around you against COVID-19 spreading. How to wear a face mask safely Different types of face masks can provide different levels of protection, depending on the type of mask and how they are used. You should find a face mask that best fits you. There are several things you should think about when choosing a face mask for you. This includes: your risk of illness from COVID-19 how well the face mask fits you layers and the filtration ability of the material comfort of the face mask. Whatever face mask you choose, remember any face mask is better than no face mask. You can use a fabric face mask. The effectiveness of fabric face masks can vary depending on the style and materials used. You should look for reusable fabric face masks that have at least 3 layers and are made of tightly woven fabric, such as cotton. Ideally face masks should also use 2 different types of fabric that still allow easy breathing but provide filtration and a good fit. Face masks with more than one layer will help contain any respiratory droplets. You can increase protection of your fabric face mask by adding a ‘filter layer’ and a nose bridge wire to mould the face mask to your face. A filter layer could be a specific face mask filter or a cut-down disposable face mask to add to a face mask pocket. Fabric face masks can still be effective for short periods of time in well-ventilated areas. Taking care of your face mask is important. You should wash fabric face masks daily using soap and hot water, and completely dry them before using again. You should have enough face masks to at least wash one and wear one. Check for wear and tear to make sure there are no holes and they are still in good condition. Many stores and online retailers offer these types of face masks. You can also make your own but make sure it has at least 3 layers. How to make a face covering Disposable face masks with ear loops can offer better protection for a longer period than fabric face masks. Especially when you are in a higher-risk indoor setting. These are the widely available ‘blue’ medical masks. They are often called ‘medical’, ‘surgical’ and ‘procedural’ masks. For use in healthcare, they must comply to a certain standard. Many surgical masks may not be certified to medical standards, but still provide effective protection. You can find these at many retail stores, supermarkets or pharmacies. Some relevant social services agencies or organisations may also be able to provide some. To make these masks fit better and get a snug fit: pinch the nose wire try layering them with a fabric mask over top knot the ear loops where they attach to the mask, then fold and tuck excess material under the edges try pulling the ear loops back and securing them with a hair tie or clip. How to wear a face mask safely Try to avoid twisting the ear loop into a figure 8, as this will likely cause a side gap that could let virus particles in. Double masking or layering can provide greater protection. The other layer, preferably a fabric mask, can help stop any leaks around the top and sides of the bottom mask. To reuse these masks, you can soak them in warm, hot or boiling water for a few minutes and hang them out to dry. You can do this up to 10 times. When they start to show wear or no longer have a good fit, dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. Disposable high-filtration face masks or particulate respirators offer the highest level of protection when used correctly. For people who are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19, the use of a P2/N95 face mask may be a better choice for you. If you choose to wear this type of face mask, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to mold these face masks to your face. You need to make sure there are no gaps and you have a tight seal against your face. These face masks can offer hours of protection when in high-risk indoor settings where there is no or little ventilation. But they need to have a very tight seal around the face to provide better protection than a well-fitting medical mask. In healthcare settings, these face masks work best when a person is ‘fit tested’ to make sure they have the right type of face mask that suits their face. Do not wash these face masks. These face masks have a special static charge that traps viruses. You can reuse these face masks several times if you leave them for a few days between each use in a cool, dry place. If they no longer provide a tight seal around your face, or are dirty or damaged, then you should dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. Particulate respirator face masks come in a variety of models, prices, availability and suitability. They are often identified by which international regulatory standard they meet. P2 is the Australia/New Zealand respiratory standard. N95 is the United States respiratory standard. KN95 is the Chinese respiratory standard. FFP2 is the European respiratory standard. Choose a face mask for children that fits them best, is comfortable to wear and can be worn consistently. The face mask should cover their nose, mouth, and chin without gaps above, below or on the sides. This can be a reusable fabric mask with 3 layers or a medical disposable mask. Many fabric masks (either purchased or made) come in child sizes. For commonly available medical masks, you can use the knot and tuck technique to improve the fit to a child's face. How to make a face mask fit tightly These types of face masks or coverings provide very little protection against transmission of COVID-19. A face shield is not recommended to be worn instead of a face mask as it will provide very little protection against droplets or aerosol spray. Dust masks or particulate respirators that have a 1-way valve are not recommended as they can allow particles from you to spread to others. Masks that are showing wear and tear. If there is any thinning of the material, holes, or the ties or elastic loops can no longer keep the mask in place, you should replace it.

Home Prepare and stay safe Healthy habits Ventilation and COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they may spread particles containing the virus. COVID-19 mostly spreads by aerosols — small virus particles that can stay in the air for minutes to hours. Good ventilation helps remove virus particles in the air. How COVID-19 spreads If you have COVID-19 you must self-isolate for 7 days. You must stay home and avoid contact with people in your household. Keep the air in your room fresh. If you can, open windows on different sides of the room to help airflow. To stop virus particles spreading, reduce airflow from your room to other parts of your home: Block gaps under your door with a towel or draught stopper. Before opening the door into shared spaces, open your window for at least 5 minutes to freshen the air. Close the window before you open the door. In a shared bathroom, switch on the extractor fan or open a window. Close the toilet lid before you flush. We encourage you to let in fresh air every day, including after someone visits your home. If you can, partly open a window about 5cm for most of the day. Or open windows for at least 15 minutes as often as possible, whenever it is practical to do so. Try 1 or more of these ways to remove stale air: Open windows or doors on opposite sides of a room to help airflow. Open doors between rooms to ventilate hallways and spaces without windows. In kitchens and bathrooms, switch on the extractor fan or open a window. Open higher windows wider than lower windows. This helps reduce draughts. If your windows do not open, check if your ventilation system filters (cleans) the air. Steamed-up windows can be a sign of low ventilation. COVID-19 and ventilation | Ministry of Health (external link) Try 1 or more of these ways to refresh air without letting rooms get chilly or damp: Partly open a window for most of the day, for example a 5cm opening. Fully open a window or door for 3 to 5 minutes every hour. Open a window whenever you leave the room, closing the door behind you. You do not have to leave windows or doors open all the time. Heat pumps, air conditioners and ceiling fans do not refresh the air. Instead, they move around air already in a room. You will need to open doors or windows to remove stale air and let in fresh air. If you have a home ventilation system, check if it recycles air or filters air: If it recycles air, you need to open windows or doors to move stale air out and let in fresh air. If it filters or cleans air, this helps remove stale air and reduce the risk of virus particles spreading. Air cleaning technologies | Ministry of Health (external link) Landlords must provide good ventilation. If you live in or own a rental property, check ventilation rules on the Tenancy Services website. Ventilation standard | Tenancy Services (external link) Virus particles can build up quickly in crowded places such as buses or trains. It helps to sit or stand close to the door as airflow will be better. Open a window on the bus or train if you can. Taxis and ride-share services often ask passengers to open windows. We encourage you to wear a face mask in crowded places such as public transport. Wearing a face mask --- Section Separator --- When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they may spread particles containing the virus. COVID-19 mostly spreads by aerosols — small virus particles that can stay in the air for minutes to hours. Good ventilation helps remove virus particles in the air. How COVID-19 spreads --- Section Separator --- If you have COVID-19 you must self-isolate for 7 days. You must stay home and avoid contact with people in your household. Keep the air in your room fresh. If you can, open windows on different sides of the room to help airflow. To stop virus particles spreading, reduce airflow from your room to other parts of your home: Block gaps under your door with a towel or draught stopper. Before opening the door into shared spaces, open your window for at least 5 minutes to freshen the air. Close the window before you open the door. In a shared bathroom, switch on the extractor fan or open a window. Close the toilet lid before you flush. --- Section Separator --- We encourage you to let in fresh air every day, including after someone visits your home. If you can, partly open a window about 5cm for most of the day. Or open windows for at least 15 minutes as often as possible, whenever it is practical to do so. Try 1 or more of these ways to remove stale air: Open windows or doors on opposite sides of a room to help airflow. Open doors between rooms to ventilate hallways and spaces without windows. In kitchens and bathrooms, switch on the extractor fan or open a window. Open higher windows wider than lower windows. This helps reduce draughts. If your windows do not open, check if your ventilation system filters (cleans) the air. Steamed-up windows can be a sign of low ventilation. COVID-19 and ventilation | Ministry of Health (external link) Try 1 or more of these ways to refresh air without letting rooms get chilly or damp: Partly open a window for most of the day, for example a 5cm opening. Fully open a window or door for 3 to 5 minutes every hour. Open a window whenever you leave the room, closing the door behind you. You do not have to leave windows or doors open all the time. Heat pumps, air conditioners and ceiling fans do not refresh the air. Instead, they move around air already in a room. You will need to open doors or windows to remove stale air and let in fresh air. If you have a home ventilation system, check if it recycles air or filters air: If it recycles air, you need to open windows or doors to move stale air out and let in fresh air. If it filters or cleans air, this helps remove stale air and reduce the risk of virus particles spreading.

Our restrictions have eased, but we still need to keep up healthy habits to keep ourselves and our whānau safe. Our high vaccination rates mean we can slowly start to focus on returning to a normal way of life. For some people, the easing of restrictions can be stressful — especially if we have friends or whānau who are vulnerable. It is okay to feel scared or anxious as we adjust to the new settings. You can decide what additional measures suit you best. Let whānau, friends, neighbours and colleagues know what they can do to support you.

Home Prepare and stay safe Preparing to self-isolate --- Section Separator --- If you test positive for COVID-19, you must self-isolate for 7 days . This means you cannot leave home to go to the supermarket, or to pick up essential supplies, like medication. You will need to have a plan for someone to collect them for you, or to get supplies delivered. Most people who get COVID-19 will have a mild to moderate illness and can safely recover in their own home. For those who need help, the healthcare system will always be available. Having a plan will make it easier when you need to self-isolate. Household Contacts no longer need to isolate for 7 days. If you live with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, we recommend you: take a rapid antigen test (RAT) each day for 5 days avoid contact with the person who has COVID-19.

Keep a safe distance from others when exercising. Looking after your mental wellbeing Check that you have basic medical supplies to help manage your symptoms. This could include pain relief, a thermometer, nasal spray, lozenges and your regular medications. If you are isolating and need medicine, you can contact your doctor or local pharmacy to arrange a delivery, or ask friends and whānau to collect it for you. Make a list of whānau information — include NHI numbers, any medical conditions and medications or medical supplies each person will need if they have to self-isolate. Include emergency contact information like your doctor, after-hours services, and any support agencies.

Most people who get COVID-19 recover from the acute signs and symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks. And they should be back to all activities they were doing before COVID-19 by 12 weeks. However, some people report a range of symptoms beyond the standard time of recovery. Symptoms of long COVID can persist for weeks or sometimes months. They can include: fatigue breathlessness cough sore throat chest tightness chest pain difficulty concentrating, cognitive impairment or 'brain fog' difficulty sleeping pins and needles dizziness joint pain muscle pain. For support with the management and treatment of long COVID, seek help from your doctor or healthcare team. COVID-19 healthcare is fully funded for up to 6 weeks from the first day of your symptoms or the day you test positive, whichever is earlier.

Home Testing and isolation Contact tracing How contact tracing works --- Section Separator --- If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to notify people you have been in close contact with that you have tested positive. This includes your workplace or school. The Ministry of Health also uses this information to notify people in vulnerable communities who may have been exposed to the virus. This process is called contact tracing. If you test positive for COVID-19 you will need to share details of where you have been recently and who you have seen. You can share this with the Ministry of Health securely online through a contact tracing form. This is instead of a case interview over the phone. If you have a valid mobile phone number, you will get a text message with a link and access code to complete this form. The COVID-19 contact tracing form lets you share: symptoms you have details of your Household Contacts details of any high-risk locations you have visited any welfare needs you may have.

Home Testing and isolation COVID-19 testing How to use a RAT --- Section Separator --- Get ready by blowing your nose and then washing and drying your hands. Lay out the contents of your RAT kit — a tube of solution, a stopper, a swab, and the test cassette. Remove the swab (it looks like a long cotton ear bud). Take the soft end and gently glide swab in 1 nostril, going low and slow, about 2 centimetres deep. Twirl the swab over the surface of the nostril around 5 times. Then repeat in your other nostril, going round again slowly 5 times. Get the tube with solution, open it, keep it upright and make sure not to spill it. Place the soft end of the swab into the solution and swirl about 5 times. You want to make sure that the swab is soaked. Pinch the swab as you are removing it — squeeze as much liquid out as you can, to keep it in the tube. Place the stopper firmly on the tube. Give the tube a shake or flick a couple of times so it gets a good mix. Then leave upright for about a minute. With the test cassette ready on a flat surface, take your tube (with the solution of your sample), and turn it upside down. Follow the kit instructions as to how many drops are needed for your test. Squeeze the drops through the stopper onto the well. Wait for 15 minutes — set a timer if that helps. Again, check with the kit instructions as the waiting time may differ. Check for results. If there is no line at the C (C for control), or there are 3 lines, then the test did not work properly this time (it is invalid — this sometimes happens). You will need to do another test. If you see a single line at the C, this shows that the test has worked and you are negative for COVID-19. If you see 2 lines (even if it is a faint line at the T) then this shows you have tested positive for COVID-19. You will need to isolate for 7 days. Please report your results (positive or negative): online: My Covid Record (external link) by calling: 0800 222 478 (choose option 3). Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can get the help you need as early as possible. How to report your RAT result Once you have finished with your rapid antigen test, you should dispose of it. Place the test and any other contaminated material, such as swabs, into the plastic bag that comes with the kit. Seal the bag and place it in your general household rubbish bin. Do not put it in your recycling. You can recycle the cardboard packaging and instructions. This information is available in a printable poster.
