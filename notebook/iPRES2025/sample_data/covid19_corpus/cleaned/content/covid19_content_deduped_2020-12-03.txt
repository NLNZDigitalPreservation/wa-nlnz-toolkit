Home COVID-19 Alert System About the Alert System --- Section Separator --- The Government reviewed Auckland’s Alert Level on Monday 5 October. It decided to move Auckland down to Alert Level 1 at 11:59pm on Wednesday 7 October. There are no more announcements planned for New Zealand’s Alert Levels. The Alert System was introduced in March 2020 to manage and minimise the risk of COVID-19 in New Zealand. The system helps people understand the current level of risk and the restrictions that legally must be followed. The measures may be updated on the basis of: new scientific knowledge about COVID-19 information about the effectiveness of intervention measures in New Zealand and elsewhere. The Alert Levels may be applied at a town, city, territorial local authority, regional or national level.

Home COVID-19 Alert System Alert Level 1 --- Section Separator --- The Ministry of Health confirmed a community case of COVID-19 in Auckland. Advice if you live in Auckland Face coverings legally must be worn: on all public transport to, from and through Auckland — including on long-distance bus and train journeys, as well as Auckland ferries on domestic flights throughout New Zealand by Auckland taxi and ride-share drivers — while it’s not compulsory for passengers to wear them, we strongly encourage you to. Wear a face covering Controls at the borders remain for those entering New Zealand. This includes health screening and testing for all arrivals, and mandatory 14 day managed isolation or quarantine. Travel to New Zealand Staying at home if you’re sick is especially important at Alert Level 1. The risk of COVID-19 being spread in the community is much greater when there are no restrictions on gatherings or going out. What to do if you’re sick If you have cold or flu symptoms, stay home and call your GP or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 to see if you need a test. COVID-19 symptoms Getting a COVID-19 test Keep up good hand washing practices, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and drying thoroughly. Cough and sneeze into your elbow. Keep surfaces clean. How to practise good hygiene and stay healthy Continuing good habits with face coverings will keep you and others safe, even at Alert Level 1. It helps stop droplets spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. You legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling on a domestic flight anywhere in New Zealand. This does not include private flights.

Home Business, work and money Business Contact tracing at your workplace --- Section Separator --- To stop any future spread of COVID-19, we need to trace the contacts of anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and break the chain of transmission. Contact tracing helps us do that. All people on-site should sign in using either the QR code or an alternative contact tracing system. This includes employees, customers and other visitors. Make sure it’s done every day, including weekends and after hours. People who sign in with the NZ COVID Tracer app don’t need to use an alternative system. All workplaces and businesses legally must display an NZ COVID Tracer QR code for each location. This applies at all Alert Levels. Get your QR code poster At Alert Level 2 and higher, you legally must have an alternative system for people who do not use the NZ COVID Tracer app. You may be contacted if your business is a potential contact. Petrol stations, supermarkets and transport stations only need to record people who work on the premises. You do not need an alternative system at Alert Level 1, but it's still a good idea to have one. There are different systems and processes you can use to keep a record, like: an electronic system, like a tablet sign-in app, work time-sheets or an existing booking system a simple pen and paper register using individual slips and a ballot box for storage an employee records visitors' details. We recommend that records include the person’s name, phone number, and the date and time they enter. Whatever you use, it’s important that everyone’s personal details are collected, kept and used in a way that protects their privacy. Previous visitors’ records should not be visible to other visitors. Unsecured personal information exposes people to unwelcome contact, fraud or even identity theft. It’s also a breach of the Privacy Act. Keep these records for at least 30 days. You should only collect information if it’s necessary for contact tracing. The purpose of the collection is to help the Ministry of Health to contact a person in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. It’s unnecessary to collect other personal information like identity verification documents or number plates. You should only ask for name, phone number and the date and time of visit. When collecting this information, tell people that it’s being collected to support contact tracing. It’s your responsibility to store any private information securely, and it can only be used for COVID-19 contact tracing. For example, you should not automatically add people’s emails to your contact database without their consent. We recommend you display a privacy statement alongside your alternative system. For example: This information is being collected to assist in the management of COVID-19. It will be given to the Ministry of Health and/or the District Health Board on request if it is required for contact tracing purposes.

At Alert Level 3, prepared food and drink can be bought and sold, but we recommend not allowing customers consuming these onsite. Independent butchers, bakeries and greengrocers can operate if they deliver or offer pre-arranged collection of goods bought online or by phone. Consumers cannot physically browse for goods. Retail stores and hospitality businesses such as bars and cafes may operate, but we recommend customers not enter the premises. Delivery, or drive-through or contactless pick up by customers is allowed. Customers can pay in cash if there is no alternative, but try to handle the cash using self-checkout kiosks or cleaning hands well after handling. We recommend customers not consume food or drink on your premises. Each business can decide if they will allow customers to use reusable cups and containers. If they allow it, we recommend managing food safety risks and adhering to food safety requirements. This applies to all reusable containers, including: personal keep cups in-house reusable coffee cup schemes used by coffee shops. During Alert Level 3, most work can be carried out in the building and construction sector. All goods can be delivered, including food. We recommend the delivery be contactless. Alcohol can be delivered if the business has an off-licence. You can provide certain services in home, provided physical distancing and other public health guidance is observed. However, we recommend not having house cleaning. --- Section Separator --- To stop any future spread of COVID-19, we need to trace the contacts of anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and break the chain of transmission.

This legal requirement applies at Alert Level 1 and higher. A separate poster is needed for each unique location. Each location legally must display their poster in a prominent place at or near the main entrance. All public transport services and small passenger services, like taxis, are legally required to display QR codes to help passengers keep track of where they've been. This includes buses, trains, aircraft, ferries and ride-share vehicles. QR codes are not mandatory for public transport services that have ticketing processes that collect contact information for every passenger. Depending on the operator, this could airlines and inter-city buses. Workplaces without fixed premises still need to display QR codes. You legally must display a code at any place where work is being carried out. This includes any place where a worker goes, or is likely to be, while at work. While QR codes are linked to a unique location, this does not have to be a fixed location. For example, you can get a QR code for a work vehicle. The NZ COVID Tracer app is our fastest way of responding to the virus — the faster we respond, the faster we stop it. The app also keeps people informed of the risk. While displaying a QR code is not mandatory in these situations, we still encourage community organisations to display a QR code. This includes: voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities faith-based gatherings community club activities. Clubs that operate under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 must still display a QR code. You can also print off QR codes for private events such as social gatherings at your home. This isn’t mandatory, but we encourage you to do so. You need to display your QR code poster at all Alert Levels. Display the poster in a prominent place at or near the main entrance. You can also place some posters inside, especially where people walk past without creating an obstacle.

This applies to: residential mortgages agriculture loans, and SME loans. You have to be financially affected by COVID-19. These loans will not be viewed as being defaulted. If you get a mortgage repayment deferral from your bank you may be able to defer principal and interest payments on your loan. Banks and customers have flexibility over the term of any deferral. However, the Reserve Bank’s  concessionary loan guidance will expire on 31 March 2021. This package is in addition to what banks are already doing individually to help affected customers. Interest on these loans will still increase, and deferred interest will be added to the principal amount of the loan. Banks will assess each customer that asks for a deferral. The Reserve Bank’s guidance is that lenders should only approve a deferral if: there’s a need for it there’s a benefit to the borrower, and the lender thinks there’s a reasonable chance of that customer resuming payments when the deferral period ends. Banks will have different approaches to how they manage the process for customers to opt into a mortgage deferral. Those details, including eligibility criteria, will be available on bank websites. Customers should contact their bank for further details or queries about the scheme.

If you’re dining in, once you have ordered or collected your food, you must return to your seat. You must stay seated unless you’re using the bathroom or paying for your meal.

You won't be allowed to enter the store, and need to maintain a 2 metre distance from others. You are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering. Don't go out to get takeaways if you're sick with cold and flu symptoms. You must self-isolate at home and ask someone else to pick food up or get it delivered. Order ahead — online or over the phone. We recommend food outlets not accept orders made at the store. Only arrive to pick up your food when it's ready, to avoid waiting around. Send only 1 person from your bubble. Pay online, or use a contactless payment method, like payWave, PayPass or Apple Pay. If you're using cash or touch the EFTPOS machine, don't touch your face until you have thoroughly washed and dried your hands. If the business allows you to use reusable containers like personal keep cups or has an in-house reusable coffee cup scheme, make sure to wipe the cup before and after you use it. Don’t wait with people in a crowd. You need to maintain a 2 metre distance from anyone not in your bubble, even if you're waiting in a queue. Be respectful to the staff — they may be dealing with high volumes. Get it and go — make your visit as quick as possible. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before eating.

Advice for going out to a bar or night club You can order and collect food from the counter in cafes or fast food restaurants that don’t hold an on-licence or club licence. If you’re dining in, once you have ordered or collected your food, you must return to your seat. You must stay seated unless you’re using the bathroom or paying for your meal. On-licensed and club-licensed premises must continue to adhere to the 3 S's at all times, with a requirement to use table service. --- Section Separator --- Food businesses can open at Alert Level 3, but only for takeaway, delivery or drive through. If you are picking up food in person, make sure you do this as safely as possible. You won't be allowed to enter the store, and need to maintain a 2 metre distance from others. You are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering. Don't go out to get takeaways if you're sick with cold and flu symptoms. You must self-isolate at home and ask someone else to pick food up or get it delivered. Order ahead — online or over the phone. We recommend food outlets not accept orders made at the store. Only arrive to pick up your food when it's ready, to avoid waiting around. Send only 1 person from your bubble. Pay online, or use a contactless payment method, like payWave, PayPass or Apple Pay. If you're using cash or touch the EFTPOS machine, don't touch your face until you have thoroughly washed and dried your hands. If the business allows you to use reusable containers like personal keep cups or has an in-house reusable coffee cup scheme, make sure to wipe the cup before and after you use it. Don’t wait with people in a crowd. You need to maintain a 2 metre distance from anyone not in your bubble, even if you're waiting in a queue. Be respectful to the staff — they may be dealing with high volumes. Get it and go — make your visit as quick as possible. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before eating.

Home Everyday life Information for Māori You might be interested in: --- Section Separator --- Iwi, hapū and Māori organisations have led decision-making in our communities to support and ensure whānau are safe and protected from any risk of COVID-19 transmission. This has included adjusting tikanga and cultural practices such as suspending harirū and hongi, kissing and hugging to maintain physical distance, and using tools such as video conferencing to support hui, tangihanga and wānanga. --- Section Separator --- At Alert Level 2 whānau and friends can connect, but restrictions are still in place to manage the risk and spread of COVID-19.

Home Everyday life Life at home Homeowners --- Section Separator --- New Zealand’s retail banks are able to defer repayments for some mortgages until 31 March 2021. This applies to: residential mortgages agriculture loans, and SME loans. You have to be financially affected by COVID-19. These loans will not be viewed as being defaulted. If you get a mortgage repayment deferral from your bank you may be able to defer principal and interest payments on your loan. Banks and customers have flexibility over the term of any deferral. However, the Reserve Bank’s  concessionary loan guidance will expire on 31 March 2021. This package is in addition to what banks are already doing individually to help affected customers. Interest on these loans will still increase, and deferred interest will be added to the principal amount of the loan. Banks will assess each customer that asks for a deferral. The Reserve Bank’s guidance is that lenders should only approve a deferral if: there’s a need for it there’s a benefit to the borrower, and the lender thinks there’s a reasonable chance of that customer resuming payments when the deferral period ends. Banks will have different approaches to how they manage the process for customers to opt into a mortgage deferral. Those details, including eligibility criteria, will be available on bank websites. Customers should contact their bank for further details or queries about the scheme. People living in apartment buildings may come into contact with contaminated surfaces in communal areas, or come across other residents who may have COVID-19. Simple guidance is now available for body corporates to support people living in apartments: Close all communal facilities such as gyms, swimming pools and other communal gathering areas. Ensure regular and robust cleaning, with particular emphasis on disinfecting surfaces in common areas, such as door handles, lift buttons and stair rails. Place hand sanitisers at all building entrances, with notices asking people to use as they enter or exit the building. If you’re a landlord, there are temporary rules for body corporate meetings. The Unit Title Services website has more information (external link) Place notices in the entrance foyer and by the lifts to advise people about this advice: Only use the lifts one at a time, or with their household group. Press lift buttons and touch door handles or stair rails with elbows or knuckles instead of fingers, or use disinfectant hand wipes after contact. Make sure all deliveries are left at the front door of the apartment building for collection. Post notices reminding people that they have to follow the government guidelines, in particular, maintaining a distance of at least 2 metres from other people, and washing hands frequently. Ask owners renting out their apartments to ensure their tenants, including any commercial tenants, know all the body corporate’s rules. Find out if there are residents who are vulnerable, over 70 years old or self-isolating in your building, and ask if there are other residents who could volunteer to support these people. For example, by collecting prescriptions or groceries on their behalf. We recommend any goods be left at their apartment door and all physical contact avoided. More information for tenants and landlords is available on the Tenancy Services website (external link) At Alert Level 3 you can move house. Travelling into and out of regions at different Alert Levels to move house is allowed, but there are restrictions. If you do move, you legally must take great care not to violate any Alert Level 3 rules. For example, we recommend signing tenancy agreements digitally, and we recommend moving house without any contact with other people. Regional travel You can have a tradesperson come to your house to do required maintenance. This includes electricians, plumbers and builders. Tradespeople and other workers do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when they come into your house, but we recommend they maintain physical distancing and undertake other hygiene measures like washing their hands and cleaning surfaces. You can buy or sell a property at Alert Level 3, but we recommend that settlement is delayed until after the Alert Level is reduced to 2 or less. You can look for properties to buy, but we recommend doing this without face-to-face contact with real estate agents, owners or existing tenants. --- Section Separator --- New Zealand’s retail banks are able to defer repayments for some mortgages until 31 March 2021.

Home Health and wellbeing COVID-19 COVID-19 symptoms --- Section Separator --- Symptoms include: a new or worsening cough a fever of at least 38°C shortness of breath sore throat sneezing and runny nose temporary loss of smell. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. Some people may also have less common symptoms such as only: fever diarrhoea headache muscle pain nausea and vomiting confusion and irritability. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline or your iwi health provider. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. If you have cold or flu symptoms, stay home and call: Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 your doctor, or your iwi health provider. A health professional will advise whether you fit the criteria for testing. Call your doctor before visiting if you have any symptoms. Let your health professional know if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case. If you’re outside New Zealand call +64 9 358 5453 or your doctor. If you’re sick, stay home. Don’t go to work or school. Don’t socialise. If you have cold or flu symptoms call your doctor or Healthline and check if you should get tested. Wash your hands. Sneeze and cough into your elbow, and regularly disinfect shared surfaces. If you are told by health authorities to self-isolate do so immediately. If you are awaiting test results you will also need to self-isolate. Information about testing for COVID-19 Like the flu, COVID-19 is spread by droplets from person to person. Good hygiene can prevent its spread. People can catch the virus through their eyes, nose or mouth. The scientific evidence proves that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may spread droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. People may get infected by the virus if they touch those surfaces or objects, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That’s why it’s really important to use good hygiene, at any time. Regularly wash and thoroughly dry your hands Sneeze and cough into your elbow Clean or disinfect shared surfaces regularly If you have cold or flu symptoms, stay home and call your doctor or Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 . --- Section Separator --- Symptoms include: a new or worsening cough a fever of at least 38°C shortness of breath sore throat sneezing and runny nose temporary loss of smell. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. Some people may also have less common symptoms such as only: fever diarrhoea headache muscle pain nausea and vomiting confusion and irritability. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline or your iwi health provider. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. --- Section Separator --- If you have cold or flu symptoms, stay home and call: Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 your doctor, or your iwi health provider. A health professional will advise whether you fit the criteria for testing. Call your doctor before visiting if you have any symptoms. Let your health professional know if you have travelled internationally in the past 14 days, or if you have been in contact with a confirmed or probable case.

If you have cold or flu symptoms call your doctor or Healthline and check if you should get tested. Wash your hands. Sneeze and cough into your elbow, and regularly disinfect shared surfaces. If you are told by health authorities to self-isolate do so immediately. If you are awaiting test results you will also need to self-isolate. Information about testing for COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- Like the flu, COVID-19 is spread by droplets from person to person. Good hygiene can prevent its spread. People can catch the virus through their eyes, nose or mouth. The scientific evidence proves that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may spread droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. People may get infected by the virus if they touch those surfaces or objects, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That’s why it’s really important to use good hygiene, at any time.

If you have symptoms and get tested, stay home until you have a negative test result. COVID-19 tests are free of charge. This applies whether you have symptoms of COVID-19 or not, and regardless of your citizenship, immigration status, nationality or level of medical insurance coverage. You may need to pay for a test if it’s for the purpose of entering another country. Getting a pre-departure COVID-19 test If you are asked to pay for a COVID-19 test, please report it to your district health board or primary health organisation. You will not be charged for your care if you test positive. You will need to provide contact details so that your results can be sent to you. You do not need to have an NHI number or ID to get tested. But it’s helpful to have your NHI number with you when you get tested. How to find your NHI number (external link) You can ask someone to help you get to your test and be with you during your test. If you are very unwell and advised by Healthline or your doctor that you need to be assessed or tested at a hospital, you can ask someone to help you get there. If you need someone with you at the hospital, you or your support person should call ahead and discuss this with the doctor or nurse at the hospital.

When you are tested, you will be told how and when to expect your results. Whether you test negative or positive, you will receive your results. If you test positive, your local public health unit will call you to discuss your results. They will advise you what to do next. What to expect if you test positive If you need to be tested for COVID-19, a sample is taken from you. There’s more than 1 way to take a sample. The most common way is to swab the back of your nose. A swab is like a small cotton-bud but with a longer stick. For some people this is a tickle, others find it a bit uncomfortable. If you get tested, we need your help to keep healthcare workers safe. That means continuing to cough and sneeze into your elbow, and staying 2 metres away from other people wherever possible. Follow any instructions you get, like turning up on time, calling ahead or waiting in your car. The people testing you may wear protective equipment likes gowns or face coverings. This is nothing to worry about, it helps protect them and everyone they’re testing.

But if you’re sick, stay home. When exercising in public, keep a 2 metre distance from people you don’t know if possible. You can do activities like: walking, biking and hunting, including on public conservation land — overnight trips are okay swimming at a public swimming pool, but there will be restrictions going to the gym, but there will be restrictions boating and motorised watersports. At Alert Level 2, you can fish for whitebait as long as you keep a 2 metre physical distance from other fishers. You also need to follow the whitebait regulations. Community sports are limited to groups of 100 in a defined space. Referees, officials and other workers providing services to a sports game are not included in the 100 people. A sports field can have multiple defined spaces by keeping: people in groups of up to 100 groups separate either through consistent 2 metre physical distancing when outdoors, or using barriers. We recommend groups be prevented from intermingling or sharing common facilities at the same time. For example, a game of rugby can occur so long as there are no more than 100 people on the field. If that field has a stand on either side, up to 100 people can gather in each stand if they are kept separate from those from the other stand and from players and umpires on the field. Organisers and the person in control of the premises are responsible for collecting contact tracing information.

Gatherings, events and public venues Exercise and recreation is an important part of maintaining our health and wellbeing. However, there's a very high risk of transmission if we come into contact with others, touch common equipment or surfaces, or need rescuing or medical care. You can do activities that are local and safe. Only exercise alone or with the people in your extended bubble. You need to keep a 2 metre distance from people who aren’t in your bubble, and you are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering. The most important thing is to stay safe. Do low-risk activities, so you don’t need rescuing or medical care. Now isn't the time to take up new activities, or expose yourself or your bubble to any risk. Use your common sense — stay local, stay safe. If you’re experienced you can do more activities. These include: surfing — if you’re an experienced surfer, you can go to your local break. If you’re not experienced, don’t surf tramping — is okay for day walks on easy trails. Remember to keep your distance from other people mountain biking — if you're experienced and know the trail swimming — in safe local spots. Don’t take risks that might mean rescue services have to break their bubble to help you horse riding — if you’re an experienced rider and it's low risk. Stay as close to home as you can. Stay within 200 metres from shore if you are kayaking, canoeing, rowing, surfing, wind surfing or paddle boarding. Boating, jet-skiing, yachting and scuba diving isn't allowed. Team sports and training is also prohibited. Stick to your local area. For example, go to your nearest beach or park, not your favourite one. You can not stay overnight at a bach or holiday home. If you're exercising outside and it's too busy to keep a 2 metre distance from others, go home — go out later. We recommend driving as short a distance as you can and still do the activity. Find detailed information about sport and recreation under each Alert Level on the Sport New Zealand website (external link) You can hunt on both private and public conservation land. You need to stay within your region and stick to your bubble. Overnight trips are not allowed. You may only hunt on foot — using quad bikes, off-road bikes, helicopters and other motorised vehicles is not allowed. Hunters can not stay in DOC huts or campgrounds under Alert Level 3 and hunting must also be consistent with the usual local area restrictions. This is not the time to take up hunting as a new hobby. Use your common sense — stay local, stay safe. If you want to go fishing you can do so from a wharf or the shore, but don’t cast off the rocks or fish from a boat. Boating isn't allowed. You can fish for whitebait at Alert Level 3 during the whitebaiting season. You can only fish locally, stay 2 metres from other river users and do not use motorised vehicles to get to your fishing spot. You legally must also comply with all current whitebait regulations, including fishing from the banks of rivers or the water’s edge, and do not enter the water or use a boat to fish. You can do conservation volunteer work — including checking trap lines, planting and weeding. We recommend only doing the project if it’s close to home. You need to be able to keep 2 metres from people outside of your bubble. We recommend not organising large volunteer groups. --- Section Separator --- At Alert Level 1, you can do your usual sport and recreation activities. There are no limits on gathering sizes.

Hunters can not stay in DOC huts or campgrounds under Alert Level 3 and hunting must also be consistent with the usual local area restrictions. This is not the time to take up hunting as a new hobby. Use your common sense — stay local, stay safe. If you want to go fishing you can do so from a wharf or the shore, but don’t cast off the rocks or fish from a boat. Boating isn't allowed. You can fish for whitebait at Alert Level 3 during the whitebaiting season. You can only fish locally, stay 2 metres from other river users and do not use motorised vehicles to get to your fishing spot. You legally must also comply with all current whitebait regulations, including fishing from the banks of rivers or the water’s edge, and do not enter the water or use a boat to fish. You can do conservation volunteer work — including checking trap lines, planting and weeding. We recommend only doing the project if it’s close to home. You need to be able to keep 2 metres from people outside of your bubble. We recommend not organising large volunteer groups. --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 How to access healthcare Exercising safely Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Te Whare Tapa Whā Mental wellbeing Funerals and tangihanga Family and sexual violence prevention People at risk of COVID-19 In an emergency

At all Alert Levels, when you leave the house you need to maintain physical distance and good hygiene practices. Ministry of Health advice for people at risk (external link) Underlying medical conditions include: serious respiratory disease, including chronic lung disease and severe asthma that needs multiple medications and medical care serious heart conditions immunocompromised conditions severe obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher hypertension that isn’t well controlled diabetes that isn’t well controlled chronic kidney disease liver disease. Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including: having chemotherapy or radiotherapy bone marrow or organ transplantation some blood cancers immune deficiencies including HIV infection prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Older people, in particular those who have underlying health issues, including respiratory issues that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 There is still a risk of COVID-19 returning to the community. These simple steps can slow the spread of the virus — protecting yourself and others. --- Section Separator --- If you're feeling unwell, isolate wherever you are and call Healthline about a free COVID-19 test. By getting a test, you're helping keep your community safe. The NZ COVID Tracer app keeps us 1 step ahead of the virus. Using the app will help our health services reach people quickly to stop any possible spread of COVID-19. Please wear a face covering whenever you're on public transport, including flights. Keep your community safe, and cover for each other. --- Section Separator --- Washing your hands is 1 of the easiest ways to keep yourself safe. Wash often. Use soap. 20 seconds. Then dry. This kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. It will keep the virus off your hands, so you won’t spread it to other people and make them sick too. Regularly clean surfaces that get touched frequently. --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 is contained at Alert Level 1, but it’s still worthwhile to keep a safe distance from people you don’t know while out and about. This will help to minimise the spread of COVID-19 if community transmission returns. Maintain physical distancing
Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Clean surfaces --- Section Separator --- Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. The scientific evidence confirms that COVID-19 is spread by droplets. This means that when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. COVID-19 can remain on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to about 3 days, and less than that for other types of surfaces. This will depend on the surface. If surfaces look visibly dirty, clean it first. It’s best to use a disinfectant. Use a disinfectant that is antiviral and follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely. --- Section Separator --- Like the flu, COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person.

Recording people’s movements helps us to do this quickly and efficiently. The faster we can trace contacts, the faster we can prevent another outbreak of the virus. How contact tracing works --- Section Separator --- At all Alert Levels, you legally must display a NZ COVID Tracer QR code poster.
Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Keep track of where you’ve been How contact tracing works --- Section Separator --- If someone has COVID-19, the Ministry of Health and district health boards (DHBs) find people who may have been in contact with them to see if they have also been infected. This process is called contact tracing. There are 2 types of contacts: close contacts casual contacts. Health services will give advice to both of these types of contacts on what they need to do. The Ministry of Health has more information about contact tracing, including: contact tracing phone calls definitions of close contacts and casual contacts informative fact sheets. How the Ministry of Health and district health boards trace people who have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 (external link) Locations of interest are places where someone confirmed with COVID-19 visited. If you visited a location of interest at a certain time, you may be classed as a casual contact. The Ministry of Health lists locations of interest and has advice on what you should do if you are a casual contact. Locations of interest in New Zealand (external link) The NZ COVID Tracer app is our fastest way of responding to the virus — the faster we respond, the faster we stop it. The app also keeps people informed of the risk. Usually this is from a test, someone visiting a doctor when ill or calling Healthline. They will be asked if they have used the official NZ COVID Tracer app to scan QR codes: If they have, this gives us all the information needed to quickly start pinpointing the source of a cluster/community transmission and anyone else who may have been exposed to the virus. It also helps if they have also taken notes for those times when the QR code wasn’t available. If they haven’t, there's a much more lengthy process to find out the same answers. This slows things down considerably, allowing COVID-19 more time to spread to others in the community. If the person was using the app and scanning QR codes, we can be certain of where they were at exact times. An alert can be issued via the app, warning others of the risk. If they weren’t using the app, an alert probably won’t be able to be sent — to avoid sending false alerts and worrying people needlessly. If an alert does go out, anyone who has been using the app instantly receives information telling them they may have been exposed to COVID-19. They then self-assess whether they, or anyone they know, has symptoms, and get in touch with Healthline if they do. People who don’t have the app won’t be able to receive the alerts. That means there may be a delay before they find out if there is a threat of the virus in their community. You can help make contact tracing easier for health officials by continuing to keep a record of where you go and who you meet.

Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Maintain physical distancing --- Section Separator --- Physical distancing, sometimes known as “social distancing”, is about keeping a safe distance from others. This is about physical distance. For your own mental health you can, and should, keep in touch with friends and family via the phone, or online. We are all being asked to play our part to refrain from physical contact to prevent the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 can spread from person to person through physical contact. As well as the impact on New Zealanders generally, this will have an effect on particular areas of tikanga Māori including kawa , as we move to protect our whānau, hapū and iwi. It will particularly affect those who are more vulnerable such as our kaumātua — our koroua and kuia . In practice, for those who don’t live together and aren’t family/whānau or close friends, this means suspending our customs of hongi and harirū , as well as kissing, hugging and other forms of close physical contact. Alternatives include waving, smiling or other non-physical contact greetings. Even if you’re wearing a face covering, we recommend still physically distancing. COVID-19 is contained at Alert Level 1, so you do not need to maintain physical distance from others. However, it’s still worthwhile keeping a safe distance from people you don’t know while out and about. This will help minimise the spread of COVID-19 if it reappears in the community. At Alert Level 1, we still need to play it safe. We all need to be ready in case COVID-19 comes back into the community. To be ready at Alert Level 1: maintain good hygiene stay home if you’re sick get tested if you have cold or flu symptoms keep track of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen. Get more advice on living at Alert Level 1, including keeping your distance, wearing face coverings and contact tracing for businesses At Alert Level 2, you can leave home and do many aspects of everyday life. You should follow public health measures and consider others around you. We still need to be careful and socialise safely to keep COVID-19 under control. What we can do: Keep a 2 metre distance in public. Take extra care if you interact with people you don’t know as it won’t be easy to do contact tracing if needed. This means making the space when you’re in places like playgrounds, parks, retail businesses, shopping malls or walking along the street. Keep 1 metre physical distance in ‘controlled environments’ where contact tracing and other public health measures are possible. This includes places like cafes, church groups, gatherings, restaurants and gyms. You can socialise at Alert Level 2, but keep track of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen. This is easier if you socialise with people you know well. If you’re feeling sick or have any symptoms of COVID-19, cold and flu-like symptoms, we recommend you stay at home and not socialise with anyone. Outside of your home, you legally must continue to keep a 2 metre distance from people at all times.

Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Stay home if you’re sick --- Section Separator --- If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and call your doctor or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice about getting tested. By getting a test, you’re helping keep your community safe. Testing is always free for everyone. Symptoms include: a new or worsening cough a fever of at least 38°C shortness of breath sore throat sneezing and runny nose temporary loss of smell. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. Shortness of breath is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate medical attention. Some people may also have less common symptoms such as only: fever diarrhoea headache muscle pain nausea and vomiting confusion and irritability. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline or your iwi health provider. We do not yet know how long symptoms take to show after a person has been infected, but current World Health Organization assessments suggest that it’s 2 to 10 days. COVID-19 symptoms Staying at home if you’re sick is the best thing you can do to stop any future spread of COVID-19. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s critical you stay at home and recover. If you’re waiting for COVID-19 test results, and have been told you need to self-isolate, you legally must do so immediately. Self-isolation means staying at home and taking common sense precautions to avoid close contact with those you live with. If somebody you live with develops symptoms of COVID-19 they should call their regular health professional. If they do not have a regular health professional they can call Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453 . If you’re unwell, we recommend not sharing a bed with others. Speak with your family and whānau about sleeping arrangements. Avoid sleeping in a common area until you’re feeling better. Aim to stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Try to keep the window open as much as possible to enable ventilation and airflow as this will help to keep clean air moving through your room. Minimise the time you spend in shared spaces such as bathrooms, kitchens and sitting rooms as much as possible and keep shared spaces clean and well ventilated. While you’re unwell, do not invite or allow social visitors, such as friends, family and whānau, to enter your home. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone or other means of contact. It's okay for friends, family, whānau or delivery drivers to drop off food and supplies. Ask them to leave items at the door. We recommend also avoiding visiting others if you’re unwell. Stay home until you have fully recovered. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups or eating utensils with other people in your home. After using these items, we recommend washing them thoroughly with soap and water, putting them in the dishwasher for cleaning, or washing them in the sink. Use your own toothbrushes, towels, washcloths or bed linen. Don't share food and drinks. Someone in your home can prepare your food, but we recommend not preparing food for others. Wash your clothing and dishes separate to others in your home. Make sure you use separate towels from other people in your house, both for drying yourself after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes. Ask your family and whānau or the people you live with to use their own towels and keep them separate. We recommend doing your own laundry. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with a sick person can be washed with other people’s items. Don't shake dirty laundry. This minimises the possibility of dispersing the virus. It may be easier for someone else to fold and put away clean laundry items such as towels and tea towels. They can also provide a supply of laundry items to you. If you don't have a washing machine, wait until you’re no longer unwell before taking your laundry to a laundrette. --- Section Separator --- If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and call your doctor or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice about getting tested.

Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Wash your hands --- Section Separator --- Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. Follow these steps to wash your hands properly: Wet hands with running water. Apply enough soap to cover wet hands. Scrub all surfaces of the hands — including the back of hands, between fingers and under nails — for at least 20 seconds. Rinse thoroughly with running water. Dry hands with a clean cloth, single-use towel or blow-drier. The same goes for hand sanitiser, use a sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub it into your hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure full coverage. Wash your hands regularly, especially: after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing after visiting a public space, including public transport, markets and places of worship after touching surfaces outside of the home after touching money before, during and after caring for a sick or vulnerable person before and after eating. Always wash your hands: after using the toilet before and after eating after handling rubbish after touching animals and pets after changing babies’ nappies or helping children use the toilet when your hands are visibly dirty. You can use any temperature of water to wash your hands. As long as you use soap, cold water and warm water both kill germs and viruses. Handwashing with soap and water or using hand sanitiser, when done correctly, are both highly effective at killing most germs and viruses. Hand sanitiser is often more convenient when you’re outside of the home, but can be expensive or difficult to find in emergency contexts. You can make handwashing easier for children by setting up a stool so they can reach water and soap by themselves. You can make it fun for them by singing their favourite songs while you help them rub their hands. Germs spread more easily from wet skin than from dry skin, so drying your hands completely is an important step. Paper towels or clean cloths are the most effective way to remove germs without spreading them to other surfaces. --- Section Separator --- Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. --- Section Separator --- Follow these steps to wash your hands properly: Wet hands with running water.

Home Health and wellbeing Protect yourself and others from COVID-19 Wear a face covering --- Section Separator --- Face coverings legally must be worn: on all public transport to, from and through Auckland — including on long-distance bus and train journeys, as well as Auckland ferries on domestic flights throughout New Zealand by Auckland taxi and ride-share drivers — while it’s not compulsory for passengers to wear them, we strongly encourage you to. Wearing a face covering helps keep you and others safe. A face covering helps stop droplets spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. This includes someone who has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. Face coverings are particularly useful when physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings are only 1 part of keeping yourself and others safe. Our strategy to protect New Zealand against COVID-19 is based on our border protections, testing, contact tracing and other public health measures, like washing hands and physical distancing. Face coverings are an extra protective physical barrier to help keep people safe. At Alert Level 1, there is still a risk of COVID-19 returning to the community. We encourage you to wear face coverings on public transport and when you cannot maintain physical distance in crowded indoor places, like in supermarkets. You legally must wear a face covering when you’re travelling on a domestic flight anywhere in New Zealand  — this does not include private flights. Be prepared by having a supply of face coverings for everyone who usually lives in your household. Add some to your household emergency kit. Face coverings legally must be worn: on all public transport to, from and through Auckland — including on long-distance bus and train journeys, as well as Auckland ferries on domestic flights throughout New Zealand by Auckland taxi and ride-share drivers — while it’s not compulsory for passengers to wear them, we strongly encourage you to. Face coverings do not need to be worn: by children under 12 by students on school buses by passengers in taxis or ride-share services, but drivers are required to on charter or group tours on private flights by drivers, pilots, staff or crew of the service if they are in a space completely separated from passengers, for example pilots in a cockpit or train drivers in a train cab. You also do not need to wear face coverings if: it is unsafe, for example if wearing one means a driver cannot safely operate the vehicle there is an emergency you have a physical or mental health illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable you need to prove your identity you need to communicate with someone who is Deaf or hard of hearing you need to take medicine you need to eat or drink it is required by law. Drivers and transport operators will not stop people without face coverings from boarding public transport. This is because some people will have legitimate reasons for not wearing a face covering. However, where possible, drivers will be encouraging passengers to wear a face covering. At Alert Levels 2 and above the risk of COVID-19 being present in the community is higher. So, wearing a face covering is more important. You legally must wear a face covering on public transport and aircraft at Alert Level 2. This includes trains, buses and ferries. They do not need to be worn: by children under 12 on school buses on charter or group tours on inter-island ferries on private scenic flights. These groups are likely to be in each other’s bubbles as part of a registered group or have space to physically distance where possible. Also, face coverings do not need to be worn: by passengers of small passenger vehicles, such as taxis and Uber. Drivers will be required to wear face coverings by people with a disability or physical or mental health condition which makes it difficult to wear a face covering if it’s not safe, for example by pilots if it affects their vision. There will be other times when it's not required. For example: In an emergency. If it’s not safe. If people need to prove their identity. To communicate with someone who is deaf. If required by law. Drivers and transport operators will not stop people without face coverings from boarding public transport. This is because some people will have legitimate reasons for not wearing a face covering. However, where possible, drivers will be encouraging passengers to wear a face covering. Children and young people do not need to wear face coverings at school. This is because the risk of infection within the school environment is low. Other public health control measures will be in place including: children and staff staying home if they’re sick contact tracing hygiene requirements. It’s not mandatory to wear a face covering. Wearing face coverings is advised where it’s not possible to practise physical distancing or to carry out contact tracing. For example, in crowded spaces on Tertiary Education Organisation campuses, or teaching and learning situations where close physical contact cannot be avoided. Teachers do not need to wear face coverings at Alert Level 2.

At Alert Level 2, when not on public transport, we recommend you consider wearing a face covering when you cannot maintain physical distance from people you do not know. At Alert Level 3, the risk of COVID-19 being present in the community is higher. You legally must wear a face covering on public transport and aircraft at Alert Level 3. This includes trains, buses, and ferries.

When you wear a face covering, it's important you use it safely. How to wear a face covering safely Most people can use non-medical-grade face coverings. These face coverings prevent the wearer from spreading diseases to others and could help protect the wearer from becoming infected. Non-medical-grade face coverings can be either single-use or reusable. A single-use face covering can only be worn once, and we recommend you throw it away after wearing it. Fabric reusable face coverings can be washed and reused. Non-medical-grade face coverings do not need to conform to any standard. This means they are not used in medical settings. You can buy non-medical-grade face coverings online or in shops like pharmacies, supermarkets and hardware stores. If you do not have a face covering, you don’t need to rush out and buy one. You can use another kind of covering, like a bandana, scarf or t-shirt. How to make a face covering At raised Alert Levels, people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are advised to avoid contact with the public. If you need to go out, and feel you are vulnerable, you may wish to discuss with your health provider whether using a medical mask is best for you. Medical masks are made to be used by health care workers. These masks provide a protective barrier between the health care worker and the people they are treating to reduce transmission of infectious diseases. They are used in combination with other measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing when required. They are not reusable and must comply with the standard AS 4381:2015, or international equivalent. Surgical masks are worn by health care professionals during healthcare procedures. They generally have a higher level of quality testing and are designed to reduce fluid splash and transmission of infectious diseases. The Ministry of Health will make sure there is enough supply and distribution of medical and surgical masks for the wider health sector. Ensuring medical, surgical and N95 (or equivalent) masks are available for health care workers and those working in high-risk COVID-19 settings, such as border control, continues to be a priority.

Home Updates and resources Latest updates Transcript of 21 October media conference --- Section Separator --- Kia ora koutou katoa , Welcome to today’s briefing.  I’ve got Dr Caroline McElnay, the Director of Public Health, with me here today to answer all the difficult questions and to support me here.  Unfortunately as you can see no sign language interpreter here but I can say there will be a limited transcript of the live webcast on the Ministry’s YouTube channel and a full transcript will be available as soon as possible after we have finished. So today there are twenty-five new cases of COVID-19 to report, twenty-three of these are imported cases at the border, and two are cases linked to the port worker that we reported on Sunday and they are workplace contacts. I will start with those workplace contacts.  The first case that I am reporting today was previously considered a casual contact of the port worker when we announced that case on Sunday.  This person who is in the small firm that the initial case works for, had a very short exposure to the case on Friday morning when they became symptomatic, that is the initial case, really we are talking about a few minutes in the same room.  This new case that we are reporting today became symptomatic yesterday and rightly was tested and has returned a positive result.  They have one household contact who is also now being tested and will be in self-isolation for the fourteen-day period. The second case that is a workplace contact actually came into our database after 9am, however we are making an exception and we are reporting the case today because there is obviously a lot of interest in this particular case and it is important that people know as soon as we have the information. So this person is a previously reported workplace contact of the initial port work reported on Sunday and the person has been at the Jet Park since Sunday.  They had been tested on Friday as part of the routine workplace testing at the port and returned a negative test and that was on top of a number of previously negative tests as part of the routine surveillance testing at the port.  The person developed symptoms yesterday and has now returned a positive result. His household contacts were contacts of contacts but we had as an extra precaution isolated and tested them anyway.  They had returned negative test results and are now considered close contacts.  They will complete the full fourteen days isolation and be retested as part of that routinely or if they develop symptoms. And obviously further interviews are underway with both of our two new cases.  They are both well contained and had already been spoken with but just to see if there is any further contact tracing that needs to happen.  And we will update that if there is further information. Infection via the Sofrana Surville ship, the original case worked on, continues to be the most likely hypothesis for where this infection originated but of course we are keeping an open mind on that.  The ship is currently in Brisbane and testing has been done.  I don’t have any testing results to give today.  If they come in we will report them, if we get some results today we will report them out of cycle.  There are nineteen crew members and we will report them as soon as they become available. I’m moving now to the situation in the Christchurch Sudima managed isolation facility which we reported on yesterday afternoon.  When we reported yesterday afternoon we had identified eleven cases.  There are now a total of eighteen cases in that facility amongst the Russian and Ukrainian fishing boat crews who all came in on a chartered flight that originated in Moscow, flew to Singapore, they remained on board in Singapore, then flew through to Christchurch and have been in that managed isolation which is dedicated just to that group of two hundred and thirty-five.  They were tested pre-departure and in fact two people didn’t get on the flight out of Moscow because they returned a positive test. Our current information is that that testing was not rapid testing, it was the nasopharyngeal swabs with PCR testing.  We have now got a number of the actual results from that testing and we are going through just checking and matching with those who we now have as positive results.  The initial ??? referencing of the threshold cycle values is that some of those cases that we have identified in that eighteen are new acute cases and some are probably historical infections just looking at the CT values but we are also doing serology testing to help us build the picture there. Those positive cases have now all been moved into a dedicated quarantine wing in the same hotel, in the Sudima.  There were rooms set aside if they were required.  Anyone who was in a room with a case is obviously also being followed up as a close contact.  They are now in single rooms.  Most of the people in that group are actually in twin rooms in the hotel at the moment and we are looking at the risks of potentially moving them into single rooms and including whether we need to use additional facilities and we will be talking with our infection prevention and control colleagues down there in managed isolation facilities. We are adding in a additional day six testing for all those people and that will happen tomorrow because we want to be sure that there hasn’t been cross-infection either on the flight or inside the facility so we will add that in, and we are fully expecting that this group may need to stay for additional days beyond the fourteen days just because of the number of infections and the nature of the double two people in one room arrangements they have been in there. All staff at the facility have been tested over the last three days and we are going to add in some additional testing for staff members, and their families are also being offered testing should they wish to take that up.  People at the airport where the travellers arrived into which was obviously Christchurch airport are being asked to be tested if they haven’t already been tested in the last couple of days and the bus company that transported them to the managed isolation facility from the airport is testing its drivers. We have some other imported cases to make up our total of what is possibly a record twenty-five cases.  We haven’t had that number of cases in a while. So there are three unrelated imported cases who arrived from London via Singapore cases on the 16th October and tested positive at routine day 3 testing at managed isolation in Christchurch. What we are now doing, I might have mentioned this yesterday, is we now have a little investigation on every client in managed isolation, looking particularly at the CT values just to see if these are likely to be acute or historic cases, particularly as we have had a number of recent cases that have only been picked up at day twelve.  And obviously the thing we are alert for is a positive day twelve test raises the possibility of some cross-infection inside the managed isolation facility so I am wanting to rule that out by checking if these cases have a high CT value and are asymptomatic it is very strongly suggestive of a historical case which again reduces the possibility there is cross-infection inside the facility. So in addition to those two other cases in managed isolation, we have a further two imported cases in MIQ facilities in Auckland. The first of these a person that arrived on 16th October from Jordan via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur and tested positive at routine day 3 testing. The second person and the final case that I am talking about today, arrived on the 17th October from Malaysia and tested positive also at routine day 3 testing. Both those cases will now go into the Auckland quarantine facility if they are not there already. So in summary, and it is rather stating the obvious, but we have a large number of cases today, two are contacts, one close and casual contacts of the community case that we announced on Sunday.  All appropriate precautions have been put in place there.  The others are all in managed isolation facilities, a number of them in a single facility, and associated with that charter flight for the fishing crews that were brought in and have been captured through our procedures at the border and are well contained.  And that is exactly why we have the protocols and procedures we have in place so we find these cases and contain them at the border. So just a summary then of the overall numbers, two previously reported cases have now considered to be recovered, and this brings our total number of active cases now to fifty-six.  The total number of confirmed cases is 1,556.  Yesterday the labs processed 6,308 tests and the grand total now is date to 1,040,911. I think that all of these cases, including the case we identified and announced over the weekend who became symptomatic on Friday as well as one of our contacts who became symptomatic yesterday reinforces our critical message, if you have symptoms do not go about your usual business, get a test, and that is a really key part of how we will continue to have an effective COVID-19 response.  Getting a test quickly allows us to rapidly identify any contacts, isolate and test them, and that is instrumental in us being able to contain any potential onward community spread.  It is also important that people continue to keep a record of where they have been.  Please use the NZ COVID app.  I know that for those of you who do, it is always a surprise when you go back and look and think gosh, I wouldn’t have remembered that I did that thirteen days ago. And my final comment is just again putting our twenty-five cases today in perspective, yesterday Spain announced around 48,000 new cases and that would be equivalent of New Zealand announcing nearly 4,000 cases in one day.  Spain is among a number of European countries that are experiencing well over a thousand new infections every day and they are implementing quite significant restrictions on movement and or going back into quite significant lockdowns, Ireland being a good example of the latter. So we have a significant pandemic, it is not going away anywhere soon.  We have done well so far, but all that matters now is what we do now and what we do next, and we all need to play our part in that.  We cannot afford to be complacent.  We are not being complacent at the border, and in managed isolation, and all New Zealanders need to make sure we are not being complacent in our community here in New Zealand.  We want to remain in the current state we are which is a high level of confidence we have eliminated community transmission of COVID-19.  I am now open to questions. Media: You said New Zealand went over and above the regulations regarding testing crew before departure, would you now like to see that added to regulations for essential workers coming out to New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: Well I think what we have got here is a really good opportunity to look at the value that pre-departure testing has or not.  And one of the things that is quite pertinent here and we are going through all the results, but it seems that all these workers did have pre-departure testing.  Now often that has to happen a few days before departure, especially if it is a PCR test, to get a result before they embark, and now we have clearly a number of positive results at day three that were negative at pre-departure testing, so what it suggests is that pre-departure testing may add some value but it won’t change anything that we do at this end and so I think the regime that we have with our fourteen days in managed isolation plus our days three and day twelve testing continues to be the mainstay of how we will keep the virus out of New Zealand. Media: Are there tight restrictions for the next lot of fishermen coming through? Dr Bloomfield: Are there tight restrictions?  We will look at that.  At this point in time, again the system is working here, and whilst there may still be the departure test it won’t change anything we do at this end, we will still be following absolutely rigid infection control or protocols and testing. Media: Those taking the test, can you explain how reliable those tests are? Dr Bloomfield: Well this is one of the challenges around pre-departure testing,  We don’t have any ability to test the validity of either the process, or the swabbing, or the laboratory or any rapid testing process so it does seem that the testing, and Caroline might want to comment on that, the nature of the testing that’s done. Dr McElnay: We are actually following that up with them.  From the information we have got it does appear to be a PCR test, a nasopharyngeal swab, and the real value of this pre-departure testing is when they test positive because obviously that’s what happened in this situation, and individuals then were not allowed to board the plane and come to New Zealand but for the negatives we just do not have access to that information to say really what is the accuracy of that test in that country Media: And are officials there being quite forthcoming with the information for you? Dr McElnay: I am not aware that there has been any issue. Media: Does the PCR testing … Dr Bloomfield: What it indicates is if they returned a negative test there if it was a good test in Moscow they got infected sometime after they were swabbed.  Now that could have been before they boarded the plane.  At least one must have been aboard that plane who was infectious and there may have been transmission on board the plane.  There may have been transmission once they arrived here.  But the important thing is we did everything the same anyway and the fact that we found these infections is evidence that the system worked. Media: ??? isolation Dr Bloomfield: My understanding is they self-isolated but again I think that, you know, our view would be of what self-isolation or quarantine arrangements might have been in place before people hopped on to the plane and whatever the testing results of the crew they are treated exactly the same when they come here because we have got real confidence in our systems here, both in the integrity of the managed isolation and the value of the day three and day twelve and any additional testing there needs to be, as well as the screening Media: Given that and the likelihood of it happening before coming here, the likelihood that someone was infectious on the plane, does that tell indicate that perhaps everybody was not self-isolating Dr Bloomfield: I couldn’t pass judgement on that but our assumption is and we know that even for the people with the best supportive environment it is quite hard to self-isolate really rigorously to the same degree of integrity that we know that we have in managed isolation.  And with that constant use of PPE, and the real discipline around infection prevention and control, the cleaning and so on, that is one of the key reasons why in early April we moved from self-isolation at home here in New Zealand to self-isolation in managed isolation. Media: Are you still comfortable that this kind of fishermen should come to New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: Ah well at this point and we are liaising with both our fishery colleagues and obviously those in charge in managed isolation, we will learn again from this particular scenario.  The key thing will be the timing of that flight because we will need to make sure the same facility will be used so we need to make sure that we are confident that before anyone leaves that facility that with anyone that is there at the moment that they are free of the virus. Media: This cohort, any in medical care or needing hospitalisation?  Any communication with Christchurch Hospital over it? Dr McElnay: I haven’t had any of that information yet.  So far my understanding is that they are all able to be managed in the quarantine facility in Christchurch. Media: Are you still investigating active cases in that cohort or do you have all of them now? Dr Bloomfield: Amongst the cohort? Dr McElnay: They have all had their first round of testing which is how we have picked up the positive and then those who tested negative will have another test, a second round of testing tomorrow, day six, and they will proceed from there.  There may be some further positives tomorrow. Media: Yesterday Sealord said the Ministry of Health did not contact the infections, they learnt about them from the media.  Why is this? Dr Bloomfield: I would have to look into that, in fact one of the reasons I became aware of this is because my understanding was Sealord had already sent some communication out so regardless of how people found out the system worked, we got positive test results, and I have a detailed timeline of when folk in Christchurch notified our team which was about ten minutes after they had found out the results and you will have seen that out of cycle we actually made an announcement yesterday afternoon because of the importance of getting this information out there. Media: When did the fishermen come into isolation in the facility? Dr Bloomfield: It was Friday afternoon that their flight arrived and so effectively that is their day zero but because of these infections we will be looking at whether actually the clock may need to be re-set because we have had this quite large number of infections. Media: Do you generally trust the Russian authorities to give you straight answers about their COVID testing results? Dr Bloomfield: Well we haven’t had any interaction with the Russian authorities previously and nor have we on this.  The testing and the pre-departure arrangements were made by our professional companies here with their counterparts there in Russia so we haven’t had any actual interactions with the Russian authorities so I couldn’t comment on that. Media: Do you think in the future maybe you will look at other countries to bring their fishing crews from, is that a consideration? Dr Bloomfield: Not from my perspective because that is up to the companies and remembering that this arrangement had been very carefully planned and put in place with our colleagues from MPI. The approval had been provided by Ministers for this to happen, and there is another crew.  Remembering that they are placing crews on these New Zealand fishing boats and some of them have been on those boats for anything up to six – twelve months because of the COVID pandemic and that is why we have been very rigorous in the planning to make sure that we were reducing any risks to the crews and of course to New Zealanders. Media: Russia has had one of the largest outbreaks in the world and Russia has been accused of fudging the numbers right through the pandemic, so is it appropriate to be seeking crews from Russia? Dr Bloomfield: We have got people coming into New Zealand, mostly New Zealanders, from all around the globe including Europe, and from the USA which have large numbers. USA has the largest number of cases of any country in the world.  We treat everybody the same because we know that our procedures are in place to reduce the risk as low as possible of any infection getting into the country. Media: Do you know from the CT values which ones are most likely to be a historical infection versus new or in category where it is hard to tell? Dr McElnay: We don’t have that information but our public health colleagues in Christchurch will have that information and will be working through that. Dr Bloomfield: Maybe you could talk generally about the values and where is the most likely acute and most likely historical Dr McElnay: Certainly our observation is that from the CT values a high CT value can certainly suggest it is more likely to be an historic case and when we have had those, particularly ones that have appeared in the community where for some reason people have been tested, they have got a high CT value and intensive investigations around that person and ceretology we’ve been able to show and we’ve been reporting these for the last few weeks, we’ve been able to demonstrate that they are a historical case. In a situation like this, the need to investigate would really be to help determine who are contacts of cases of that historic case, you don’t have an issue to do with infectiousness of that individual so that is why this particular group would be a mixture of looking at who is historic versus those that are acute.  And for the acute ones that is particularly because they are actively infectious.  I want to reiterate what Ashley said earlier, our quarantine and isolation facilities are set up to manage infection prevention and control so we would assume that anyone could potentially be infectious at any time. Media: If it is a casual contact out of the cluster, is that ??? Dr Bloomfield: Again, on the basis of the history from the original case, which was found on Saturday night by the public health unit they judged this person as a casual contact because their interaction was fleeting. One of the things that we will now be looking at, in the public health unit they will be looking at, is because we now have the two work colleagues who are positive, it could have been the exposure of, the person may have been a casual contact of the original case but may have been a close contact of the other new cases and the person in Jet Park so again it is an opportunity to learn but remember what we do with casual contacts many of those we are testing up front but otherwise they have very clear instructions about what to do and especially if they become symptomatic as happened in this case. Media: Scan numbers for the tracer app have been going down for a while now, what is the Ministry doing to get people back to using that? Dr Bloomfield: Well two things, first I will be encouraging people every day and we will be pushing out the message for people to keep using it.  What we have seen is that when there is an imperative to use clearly kiwis are quite happy to use it.  But I think the other important point here is we are still developing the app and we are still actively looking at blue tooth functionality for it.  And I guess when we are in more of a sort of a, when we were in a high alert level and we have seen that in Auckland and around the country, people not only took up the app, but they were using it at high levels.  When we were in alert level one as we are now, that blue tooth functionality will be of additional value because it doesn’t require people to actively take their phone off and do the QR scanning so we are still looking at that – it will be one of the functionalities we are intending to add to the app, and I think again it’s value will particularly be of importance when at the higher alert levels. Media: Do you know what conditions were put on this crew and do you know if they were followed? Dr Bloomfield: What sort of conditions? Media: Like were MPI putting or Ministry of Health putting any conditions for this crew to fulfil to come over? Dr Bloomfield: Well I don’t have the details but as I said before there was some very rigorous planning around this including the requirement for the self-isolation, before they departed for the pre-departure testing, it was a dedicated charter flight, both legs, they were in a dedicated part of the facility, there is additional security being provided at the facility, so there were some bespoke arrangements for this crew and that was all arranged with the companies and with our colleagues in fisheries. Media: Beyond that do you feel there is industry that will want to bring cohorts of this size in the future, is there anything that you are learning from this experience that you think that you will have to tweak for next time as part of the planning? Dr Bloomfield: Well most certainly and most particularly for the next group of these fishermen that is due to arrive within a couple of weeks time as well, there will be plenty we will have learnt.  This isn’t the first group of essential workers that has come.  I think we have had vets, and we have had some agricultural workers that have come in but this is obviously the biggest group and again one of the challenges here is they have come with many of them are not English speakers, and so they have come from the Ukraine and Russia, and we have got interpreters involved a well, but all these things will help us learn. Media: Is there anything specific that you will already change for the future? Dr Bloomfield: I guess we are less than 24 hours into this one but what I can say, we have already, we are already changing for this cohort, is adding in the day six testing, so that is a new thing because of what has happened here. Media: You talked about the delay between testing and departure, do you know how much that is? Dr Bloomfield: I don’t have that information but if we find out we can let you know.  We will make that public. Media: And in terms of the day six testing, are they still being confined to their rooms? Dr Bloomfield: No they are not being confined to rooms.  And in fact they have been allowed out for breaks including cigarette breaks. Media: So is the day six testing because of that or are you concerned at the number of active people moving around the facility? Dr Bloomfield: Yeah, two reasons, one is of course that there is the twin-rooming which is unusual.  Usually people are either in family bubbles or in individual rooms, but secondly just to make sure that there hasn’t been any cross-contamination in those first few days because we have found that quite large number of positive results. Media: Do you know if there has been any cross-contamination? Dr Bloomfield: Well I don’t know exactly but what I can say is when we talked about this with colleagues this morning with the staff, there has been high levels of compliance, there has been the usual oversight security and support for infection and prevention control. Media: Those measures which you mentioned before which they are required to comply with, were they requirements that New Zealand put on them or were they requirements between the two countries? Dr Bloomfield: I think they were, what I would say is that they were arrangements that were agreed between New Zealand officials and the fishing companies to help facilitate getting this workforce over here in a way that was safe for New Zealanders.  And that is obviously a key priority. Media: Are their other international fishing crews in other facilities around New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: No, not that I know of. Media: When you look at the bigger picture here though, there was supposed to be two weeks of self-isolation, then there was supposed to be testing before they left.  As you said those measures were put in place and within four or five days of arrival you have got more than 8% of the cohort testing positive, does that kind of strain the credibility that those things might not have actually happened? Dr Bloomfield: I think what it does is reinforce the importance of the protocols we have got here because you know just also by way of example, a number of the flights that come to New Zealand, particularly from the middle East, have pre-departure testing as well as the rapid testing at the airport but we still get positive so anybody that tests positive isn’t allowed to board the flight but we still get positive results here on day three testing so I think what it does show is that pre-departure testing may add value in some circumstances so that anyone that tests positive cannot board the flight but it doesn’t change what we do in New Zealand with our managed isolation.. Media: With the port worker and the contacts and so on, I don’t know if you will be able to answer this, but are there any ongoing investigations to like contacts of contacts? Any other workplaces needing to be scrutinized?  How many others may be out there? Dr McElnay: Auckland Regional Public Health have been actively following up further investigations from the two identified and reported today.  The focus to date has been around the port and the ships and the original case that we reported over the weekend.  The two ships that that case had been on.  So they are actively following those up.  With testing, we are taking a very proactive approach to contacts of contacts and we have certainly reiterated that message to Auckland Regional Public Health. Media: Family members of port workers, presumably they operate outside the port environment in the community.  Is there concern about that? Dr Bloomfield: There is not and I tell you why not.  Just to reiterate this is a very small company of four employees, it is not actually based at the port.  And so the only interaction that those workers have, even though they are described as port workers they are not based at the port – they work on the ships and the only interaction they really have at the port is with the security guards as they go through and straight to the ships.  Hence the focus on workplace contacts in the small workplace with four people and the ships and others who might have worked on the ships, particularly the one that is now in Brisbane, so the pilot and any stevedores that were involved in the work on that ship when it was in New Zealand, they have also been stood down and tested. Media: Many nurses that Newshub has spoken to have left their jobs in managed isolation sites after the DHB took over, they say their current shortages are dangerous for staff and internal documents confirm there is a shortage.  Do you have any concerns about this? Dr Bloomfield: I don’t, and I don’t share the same view, and in fact, if I give an example, across the managed isolation facilities in Auckland there are 175 nurses and health care assistants that work across there.  At the moment, as of last week actually, there were 120 of those employed by the DHBs and presumably they had taken up that role because they were comfortable with the work there.  There was still an arrangement in place to use 55 agency staff, that is Geneva, the company that has been involved right from the start in Auckland, so the DHB is moving to recruit to a fully DHB-employed workforce.  They are great people who are doing excellent work to help keep New Zealand safe. Media: We have been told of that the current claim - that nurse numbers is not safe and sufficient is not true and that nurses are burnt out.  What evidence do you have to suggest all is going well? Dr Bloomfield: I have great confidence in my colleague Margie Apa who is the Chief Executive of Counties Manukau District Heath Board and her team who are overseeing the clinical supervision and the clinical support of the nursing and the health care staff who work at quarantine facilities and managed care isolation.  What I do know is that if there are any issues they would be open to hearing those and to acting promptly on any of those issues. Media: Do you have any update on the crew of the ?? in Hawke’s Bay? Dr Bloomfield: That ship is still off-shore.  At the moment we are still considering them as close contacts and Caroline has got the latest information. Dr McElnay: Yes, because the port worker was on that ship during his infectious period as the people on that ship, we don’t consider them to be the source of the infection but we do consider that they have been close contacts so they are receiving daily checks, so that is underway, that has been happening since the weekend.  The ship is still off the coast at Napier, and we are just waiting on updates from the shipping company around where the ship will move to next. Media: Is there any concern? Dr McElnay: No, they are all symptom free. Dr Bloomfield: I think just the other comment to make on that is even if they are not tested in that fourteen day period, if they subsequently want to come on shore, anyone who comes on shore will require the whole crew to be tested and to get a test and to test negative. Media: How confident are you that you have got it contained now or not? Dr Bloomfield: Well it is contained in the sense that they are all in a managed isolation facility.  I would be surprised if we don’t find more cases either at the testing tomorrow or on day twelve, and whether those are acute or historical will be the important thing.  That is why we are testing at day six as an interim measure and then of course once we have got any results from that if that requires further testing or extension of that managed isolation period that will be one of the decisions that will be considered. Media: Is there any chance that it could be through the whole crew. That it has reached that point? Dr Bloomfield: No I don’t think so, because remember that once they have arrived in the facility even though they might be sharing rooms, there are very strict protocols in there and they are very carefully supervised and we have reports that there is a high level of compliance there.  And that is exactly why we have those arrangements in place. Media: We have been told that there are no dedicated swabbing teams any more.  On duty nurses are expected to do health checks and swabbing.  Is this a problem? Dr Bloomfield: No I don’t think it’s a problem. Media: Last week or maybe the week before there were a group of academics that released a statement.  Do you have any comment on that? Dr Bloomfield: Yes, I do know a bit about the statement and at the same time I have seen a bit of very credible and prominent public health leaders from around the globe take a compelling I think and opposing view.  And again I think the extent to which New Zealand has been successful in using lockdowns for a defined time and for the shortest time possible which a number of countries have done successfully, including Australia, and there are many others, I think is testament to the fact that lockdowns can and should play a place where necessary as part of a response.  But just to reiterate, the WHO view on this, which is not the first tool you should reach for in the bag, but in New Zealand as we have learnt more and more our strength and our border approach around testing, contact tracing, isolation, part of the reason for that is the less use of lockdowns in the future and I think with our management of the last two or three community-based infections, that is possible, and other countries have shown the same.  Did you want to comment Caroline? Dr McElnay: No Dr Bloomfield: She agrees with me. Media: The other ship that has been stopped from docking in Australia until we know more, you have said that is the likely source of infection.  Do we know any more about when we get more information about that.  Do you have ongoing discussions with Australia? Dr Bloomfield: Very intense discussions with Australia.  It is actually in Australia in Brisbane.  It got there two evenings ago.  The crew, all nineteen, have been tested.  We are just awaiting the results.  They are a couple of hours behind us timewise but I hope, I think people will recognise Queensland is one of the states that has got very strict internal border arrangements and restrictions and so they are obviously very keen to ensure that no-one in that crew is likely to be infectious and if they have positive results they will be genome sequencing to see if we can get a match with the cases that we have got here. Media: So will it be today or tomorrow that we will know the results of those? Dr Bloomfield: I would expect today and once we find out we will make that information available. Media: You have outlined previously why that seems to be contained and you see no immediate change to level or restrictions, what would need to happen for you to recommend that move? Dr Bloomfield: Well I think a move to level two would have been something that we might have advised when we first found the case if we were not clear where it had come from or if we had found some other cases coming out that we weren’t aware of but in this case we have a really strong line of inquiry for where this person might have become infected and we were able to identify very quickly their close contacts and isolate those people.  So, I think that is the system working as it should in the community. Media: So if the tests all come back negative, and you don’t see any link to that, does that scare you? Dr Bloomfield: Yes that is something that we discussed earlier on.  I mean, we will cross that bridge but it seems that in terms of timing and nature of the sub-type of the virus which is not one we’ve had in New Zealand before, it is not a common one from Australia or the UK, or the USA, it seems that that is almost certainly the most likely source of the infection. Dr McElnay: Just to add to that, every case has its own case investigation and it may be that the case that we reported today that had a common exposure to the one reported over the weekend and had gone to the same ship, it may be that there is something else in that individual’s history that gives us a stronger line of inquiry, those are the sorts of questions that Regional Public Health will be going over today just in case it looks like the Sofrana is not the source of infection. Media: Does it shine any more light for you on the Americold case that this is the possible source of infection for the three ships Dr Bloomfield: No it doesn’t shine any more light on that.  What it does confirm is that the virus can come in through anywhere in the border at any point in time and that is why we have continually strengthened our arrangements including the very now well-established surveillance testing of workers at sea ports and at airports. --- Section Separator --- Kia ora koutou katoa , Welcome to today’s briefing.  I’ve got Dr Caroline McElnay, the Director of Public Health, with me here today to answer all the difficult questions and to support me here.  Unfortunately as you can see no sign language interpreter here but I can say there will be a limited transcript of the live webcast on the Ministry’s YouTube channel and a full transcript will be available as soon as possible after we have finished. So today there are twenty-five new cases of COVID-19 to report, twenty-three of these are imported cases at the border, and two are cases linked to the port worker that we reported on Sunday and they are workplace contacts. I will start with those workplace contacts.  The first case that I am reporting today was previously considered a casual contact of the port worker when we announced that case on Sunday.  This person who is in the small firm that the initial case works for, had a very short exposure to the case on Friday morning when they became symptomatic, that is the initial case, really we are talking about a few minutes in the same room.  This new case that we are reporting today became symptomatic yesterday and rightly was tested and has returned a positive result.  They have one household contact who is also now being tested and will be in self-isolation for the fourteen-day period. The second case that is a workplace contact actually came into our database after 9am, however we are making an exception and we are reporting the case today because there is obviously a lot of interest in this particular case and it is important that people know as soon as we have the information. So this person is a previously reported workplace contact of the initial port work reported on Sunday and the person has been at the Jet Park since Sunday.  They had been tested on Friday as part of the routine workplace testing at the port and returned a negative test and that was on top of a number of previously negative tests as part of the routine surveillance testing at the port.  The person developed symptoms yesterday and has now returned a positive result. His household contacts were contacts of contacts but we had as an extra precaution isolated and tested them anyway.  They had returned negative test results and are now considered close contacts.  They will complete the full fourteen days isolation and be retested as part of that routinely or if they develop symptoms. And obviously further interviews are underway with both of our two new cases.  They are both well contained and had already been spoken with but just to see if there is any further contact tracing that needs to happen.  And we will update that if there is further information. Infection via the Sofrana Surville ship, the original case worked on, continues to be the most likely hypothesis for where this infection originated but of course we are keeping an open mind on that.  The ship is currently in Brisbane and testing has been done.  I don’t have any testing results to give today.  If they come in we will report them, if we get some results today we will report them out of cycle.  There are nineteen crew members and we will report them as soon as they become available. I’m moving now to the situation in the Christchurch Sudima managed isolation facility which we reported on yesterday afternoon.  When we reported yesterday afternoon we had identified eleven cases.  There are now a total of eighteen cases in that facility amongst the Russian and Ukrainian fishing boat crews who all came in on a chartered flight that originated in Moscow, flew to Singapore, they remained on board in Singapore, then flew through to Christchurch and have been in that managed isolation which is dedicated just to that group of two hundred and thirty-five.  They were tested pre-departure and in fact two people didn’t get on the flight out of Moscow because they returned a positive test. Our current information is that that testing was not rapid testing, it was the nasopharyngeal swabs with PCR testing.  We have now got a number of the actual results from that testing and we are going through just checking and matching with those who we now have as positive results.  The initial ??? referencing of the threshold cycle values is that some of those cases that we have identified in that eighteen are new acute cases and some are probably historical infections just looking at the CT values but we are also doing serology testing to help us build the picture there. Those positive cases have now all been moved into a dedicated quarantine wing in the same hotel, in the Sudima.  There were rooms set aside if they were required.  Anyone who was in a room with a case is obviously also being followed up as a close contact.  They are now in single rooms.  Most of the people in that group are actually in twin rooms in the hotel at the moment and we are looking at the risks of potentially moving them into single rooms and including whether we need to use additional facilities and we will be talking with our infection prevention and control colleagues down there in managed isolation facilities. We are adding in a additional day six testing for all those people and that will happen tomorrow because we want to be sure that there hasn’t been cross-infection either on the flight or inside the facility so we will add that in, and we are fully expecting that this group may need to stay for additional days beyond the fourteen days just because of the number of infections and the nature of the double two people in one room arrangements they have been in there. All staff at the facility have been tested over the last three days and we are going to add in some additional testing for staff members, and their families are also being offered testing should they wish to take that up.  People at the airport where the travellers arrived into which was obviously Christchurch airport are being asked to be tested if they haven’t already been tested in the last couple of days and the bus company that transported them to the managed isolation facility from the airport is testing its drivers. We have some other imported cases to make up our total of what is possibly a record twenty-five cases.  We haven’t had that number of cases in a while. So there are three unrelated imported cases who arrived from London via Singapore cases on the 16th October and tested positive at routine day 3 testing at managed isolation in Christchurch. What we are now doing, I might have mentioned this yesterday, is we now have a little investigation on every client in managed isolation, looking particularly at the CT values just to see if these are likely to be acute or historic cases, particularly as we have had a number of recent cases that have only been picked up at day twelve.  And obviously the thing we are alert for is a positive day twelve test raises the possibility of some cross-infection inside the managed isolation facility so I am wanting to rule that out by checking if these cases have a high CT value and are asymptomatic it is very strongly suggestive of a historical case which again reduces the possibility there is cross-infection inside the facility. So in addition to those two other cases in managed isolation, we have a further two imported cases in MIQ facilities in Auckland. The first of these a person that arrived on 16th October from Jordan via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur and tested positive at routine day 3 testing. The second person and the final case that I am talking about today, arrived on the 17th October from Malaysia and tested positive also at routine day 3 testing. Both those cases will now go into the Auckland quarantine facility if they are not there already. So in summary, and it is rather stating the obvious, but we have a large number of cases today, two are contacts, one close and casual contacts of the community case that we announced on Sunday.  All appropriate precautions have been put in place there.  The others are all in managed isolation facilities, a number of them in a single facility, and associated with that charter flight for the fishing crews that were brought in and have been captured through our procedures at the border and are well contained.  And that is exactly why we have the protocols and procedures we have in place so we find these cases and contain them at the border. So just a summary then of the overall numbers, two previously reported cases have now considered to be recovered, and this brings our total number of active cases now to fifty-six.  The total number of confirmed cases is 1,556.  Yesterday the labs processed 6,308 tests and the grand total now is date to 1,040,911. I think that all of these cases, including the case we identified and announced over the weekend who became symptomatic on Friday as well as one of our contacts who became symptomatic yesterday reinforces our critical message, if you have symptoms do not go about your usual business, get a test, and that is a really key part of how we will continue to have an effective COVID-19 response.  Getting a test quickly allows us to rapidly identify any contacts, isolate and test them, and that is instrumental in us being able to contain any potential onward community spread.  It is also important that people continue to keep a record of where they have been.  Please use the NZ COVID app.  I know that for those of you who do, it is always a surprise when you go back and look and think gosh, I wouldn’t have remembered that I did that thirteen days ago. And my final comment is just again putting our twenty-five cases today in perspective, yesterday Spain announced around 48,000 new cases and that would be equivalent of New Zealand announcing nearly 4,000 cases in one day.  Spain is among a number of European countries that are experiencing well over a thousand new infections every day and they are implementing quite significant restrictions on movement and or going back into quite significant lockdowns, Ireland being a good example of the latter. So we have a significant pandemic, it is not going away anywhere soon.  We have done well so far, but all that matters now is what we do now and what we do next, and we all need to play our part in that.  We cannot afford to be complacent.  We are not being complacent at the border, and in managed isolation, and all New Zealanders need to make sure we are not being complacent in our community here in New Zealand.  We want to remain in the current state we are which is a high level of confidence we have eliminated community transmission of COVID-19.  I am now open to questions. --- Section Separator --- Media: You said New Zealand went over and above the regulations regarding testing crew before departure, would you now like to see that added to regulations for essential workers coming out to New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: Well I think what we have got here is a really good opportunity to look at the value that pre-departure testing has or not.  And one of the things that is quite pertinent here and we are going through all the results, but it seems that all these workers did have pre-departure testing.  Now often that has to happen a few days before departure, especially if it is a PCR test, to get a result before they embark, and now we have clearly a number of positive results at day three that were negative at pre-departure testing, so what it suggests is that pre-departure testing may add some value but it won’t change anything that we do at this end and so I think the regime that we have with our fourteen days in managed isolation plus our days three and day twelve testing continues to be the mainstay of how we will keep the virus out of New Zealand. Media: Are there tight restrictions for the next lot of fishermen coming through? Dr Bloomfield: Are there tight restrictions?  We will look at that.  At this point in time, again the system is working here, and whilst there may still be the departure test it won’t change anything we do at this end, we will still be following absolutely rigid infection control or protocols and testing. Media: Those taking the test, can you explain how reliable those tests are? Dr Bloomfield: Well this is one of the challenges around pre-departure testing,  We don’t have any ability to test the validity of either the process, or the swabbing, or the laboratory or any rapid testing process so it does seem that the testing, and Caroline might want to comment on that, the nature of the testing that’s done. Dr McElnay: We are actually following that up with them.  From the information we have got it does appear to be a PCR test, a nasopharyngeal swab, and the real value of this pre-departure testing is when they test positive because obviously that’s what happened in this situation, and individuals then were not allowed to board the plane and come to New Zealand but for the negatives we just do not have access to that information to say really what is the accuracy of that test in that country Media: And are officials there being quite forthcoming with the information for you? Dr McElnay: I am not aware that there has been any issue. Media: Does the PCR testing … Dr Bloomfield: What it indicates is if they returned a negative test there if it was a good test in Moscow they got infected sometime after they were swabbed.  Now that could have been before they boarded the plane.  At least one must have been aboard that plane who was infectious and there may have been transmission on board the plane.  There may have been transmission once they arrived here.  But the important thing is we did everything the same anyway and the fact that we found these infections is evidence that the system worked. Media: ??? isolation Dr Bloomfield: My understanding is they self-isolated but again I think that, you know, our view would be of what self-isolation or quarantine arrangements might have been in place before people hopped on to the plane and whatever the testing results of the crew they are treated exactly the same when they come here because we have got real confidence in our systems here, both in the integrity of the managed isolation and the value of the day three and day twelve and any additional testing there needs to be, as well as the screening Media: Given that and the likelihood of it happening before coming here, the likelihood that someone was infectious on the plane, does that tell indicate that perhaps everybody was not self-isolating Dr Bloomfield: I couldn’t pass judgement on that but our assumption is and we know that even for the people with the best supportive environment it is quite hard to self-isolate really rigorously to the same degree of integrity that we know that we have in managed isolation.  And with that constant use of PPE, and the real discipline around infection prevention and control, the cleaning and so on, that is one of the key reasons why in early April we moved from self-isolation at home here in New Zealand to self-isolation in managed isolation. Media: Are you still comfortable that this kind of fishermen should come to New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: Ah well at this point and we are liaising with both our fishery colleagues and obviously those in charge in managed isolation, we will learn again from this particular scenario.  The key thing will be the timing of that flight because we will need to make sure the same facility will be used so we need to make sure that we are confident that before anyone leaves that facility that with anyone that is there at the moment that they are free of the virus. Media: This cohort, any in medical care or needing hospitalisation?  Any communication with Christchurch Hospital over it? Dr McElnay: I haven’t had any of that information yet.  So far my understanding is that they are all able to be managed in the quarantine facility in Christchurch. Media: Are you still investigating active cases in that cohort or do you have all of them now? Dr Bloomfield: Amongst the cohort? Dr McElnay: They have all had their first round of testing which is how we have picked up the positive and then those who tested negative will have another test, a second round of testing tomorrow, day six, and they will proceed from there.  There may be some further positives tomorrow. Media: Yesterday Sealord said the Ministry of Health did not contact the infections, they learnt about them from the media.  Why is this? Dr Bloomfield: I would have to look into that, in fact one of the reasons I became aware of this is because my understanding was Sealord had already sent some communication out so regardless of how people found out the system worked, we got positive test results, and I have a detailed timeline of when folk in Christchurch notified our team which was about ten minutes after they had found out the results and you will have seen that out of cycle we actually made an announcement yesterday afternoon because of the importance of getting this information out there. Media: When did the fishermen come into isolation in the facility? Dr Bloomfield: It was Friday afternoon that their flight arrived and so effectively that is their day zero but because of these infections we will be looking at whether actually the clock may need to be re-set because we have had this quite large number of infections. Media: Do you generally trust the Russian authorities to give you straight answers about their COVID testing results? Dr Bloomfield: Well we haven’t had any interaction with the Russian authorities previously and nor have we on this.  The testing and the pre-departure arrangements were made by our professional companies here with their counterparts there in Russia so we haven’t had any actual interactions with the Russian authorities so I couldn’t comment on that. Media: Do you think in the future maybe you will look at other countries to bring their fishing crews from, is that a consideration? Dr Bloomfield: Not from my perspective because that is up to the companies and remembering that this arrangement had been very carefully planned and put in place with our colleagues from MPI. The approval had been provided by Ministers for this to happen, and there is another crew.  Remembering that they are placing crews on these New Zealand fishing boats and some of them have been on those boats for anything up to six – twelve months because of the COVID pandemic and that is why we have been very rigorous in the planning to make sure that we were reducing any risks to the crews and of course to New Zealanders. Media: Russia has had one of the largest outbreaks in the world and Russia has been accused of fudging the numbers right through the pandemic, so is it appropriate to be seeking crews from Russia? Dr Bloomfield: We have got people coming into New Zealand, mostly New Zealanders, from all around the globe including Europe, and from the USA which have large numbers. USA has the largest number of cases of any country in the world.  We treat everybody the same because we know that our procedures are in place to reduce the risk as low as possible of any infection getting into the country. Media: Do you know from the CT values which ones are most likely to be a historical infection versus new or in category where it is hard to tell? Dr McElnay: We don’t have that information but our public health colleagues in Christchurch will have that information and will be working through that. Dr Bloomfield: Maybe you could talk generally about the values and where is the most likely acute and most likely historical Dr McElnay: Certainly our observation is that from the CT values a high CT value can certainly suggest it is more likely to be an historic case and when we have had those, particularly ones that have appeared in the community where for some reason people have been tested, they have got a high CT value and intensive investigations around that person and ceretology we’ve been able to show and we’ve been reporting these for the last few weeks, we’ve been able to demonstrate that they are a historical case. In a situation like this, the need to investigate would really be to help determine who are contacts of cases of that historic case, you don’t have an issue to do with infectiousness of that individual so that is why this particular group would be a mixture of looking at who is historic versus those that are acute.  And for the acute ones that is particularly because they are actively infectious.  I want to reiterate what Ashley said earlier, our quarantine and isolation facilities are set up to manage infection prevention and control so we would assume that anyone could potentially be infectious at any time. Media: If it is a casual contact out of the cluster, is that ??? Dr Bloomfield: Again, on the basis of the history from the original case, which was found on Saturday night by the public health unit they judged this person as a casual contact because their interaction was fleeting. One of the things that we will now be looking at, in the public health unit they will be looking at, is because we now have the two work colleagues who are positive, it could have been the exposure of, the person may have been a casual contact of the original case but may have been a close contact of the other new cases and the person in Jet Park so again it is an opportunity to learn but remember what we do with casual contacts many of those we are testing up front but otherwise they have very clear instructions about what to do and especially if they become symptomatic as happened in this case. Media: Scan numbers for the tracer app have been going down for a while now, what is the Ministry doing to get people back to using that? Dr Bloomfield: Well two things, first I will be encouraging people every day and we will be pushing out the message for people to keep using it.  What we have seen is that when there is an imperative to use clearly kiwis are quite happy to use it.  But I think the other important point here is we are still developing the app and we are still actively looking at blue tooth functionality for it.  And I guess when we are in more of a sort of a, when we were in a high alert level and we have seen that in Auckland and around the country, people not only took up the app, but they were using it at high levels.  When we were in alert level one as we are now, that blue tooth functionality will be of additional value because it doesn’t require people to actively take their phone off and do the QR scanning so we are still looking at that – it will be one of the functionalities we are intending to add to the app, and I think again it’s value will particularly be of importance when at the higher alert levels. Media: Do you know what conditions were put on this crew and do you know if they were followed? Dr Bloomfield: What sort of conditions? Media: Like were MPI putting or Ministry of Health putting any conditions for this crew to fulfil to come over? Dr Bloomfield: Well I don’t have the details but as I said before there was some very rigorous planning around this including the requirement for the self-isolation, before they departed for the pre-departure testing, it was a dedicated charter flight, both legs, they were in a dedicated part of the facility, there is additional security being provided at the facility, so there were some bespoke arrangements for this crew and that was all arranged with the companies and with our colleagues in fisheries. Media: Beyond that do you feel there is industry that will want to bring cohorts of this size in the future, is there anything that you are learning from this experience that you think that you will have to tweak for next time as part of the planning? Dr Bloomfield: Well most certainly and most particularly for the next group of these fishermen that is due to arrive within a couple of weeks time as well, there will be plenty we will have learnt.  This isn’t the first group of essential workers that has come.  I think we have had vets, and we have had some agricultural workers that have come in but this is obviously the biggest group and again one of the challenges here is they have come with many of them are not English speakers, and so they have come from the Ukraine and Russia, and we have got interpreters involved a well, but all these things will help us learn. Media: Is there anything specific that you will already change for the future? Dr Bloomfield: I guess we are less than 24 hours into this one but what I can say, we have already, we are already changing for this cohort, is adding in the day six testing, so that is a new thing because of what has happened here. Media: You talked about the delay between testing and departure, do you know how much that is? Dr Bloomfield: I don’t have that information but if we find out we can let you know.  We will make that public. Media: And in terms of the day six testing, are they still being confined to their rooms? Dr Bloomfield: No they are not being confined to rooms.  And in fact they have been allowed out for breaks including cigarette breaks. Media: So is the day six testing because of that or are you concerned at the number of active people moving around the facility? Dr Bloomfield: Yeah, two reasons, one is of course that there is the twin-rooming which is unusual.  Usually people are either in family bubbles or in individual rooms, but secondly just to make sure that there hasn’t been any cross-contamination in those first few days because we have found that quite large number of positive results. Media: Do you know if there has been any cross-contamination? Dr Bloomfield: Well I don’t know exactly but what I can say is when we talked about this with colleagues this morning with the staff, there has been high levels of compliance, there has been the usual oversight security and support for infection and prevention control. Media: Those measures which you mentioned before which they are required to comply with, were they requirements that New Zealand put on them or were they requirements between the two countries? Dr Bloomfield: I think they were, what I would say is that they were arrangements that were agreed between New Zealand officials and the fishing companies to help facilitate getting this workforce over here in a way that was safe for New Zealanders.  And that is obviously a key priority. Media: Are their other international fishing crews in other facilities around New Zealand? Dr Bloomfield: No, not that I know of. Media: When you look at the bigger picture here though, there was supposed to be two weeks of self-isolation, then there was supposed to be testing before they left.  As you said those measures were put in place and within four or five days of arrival you have got more than 8% of the cohort testing positive, does that kind of strain the credibility that those things might not have actually happened? Dr Bloomfield: I think what it does is reinforce the importance of the protocols we have got here because you know just also by way of example, a number of the flights that come to New Zealand, particularly from the middle East, have pre-departure testing as well as the rapid testing at the airport but we still get positive so anybody that tests positive isn’t allowed to board the flight but we still get positive results here on day three testing so I think what it does show is that pre-departure testing may add value in some circumstances so that anyone that tests positive cannot board the flight but it doesn’t change what we do in New Zealand with our managed isolation.. Media: With the port worker and the contacts and so on, I don’t know if you will be able to answer this, but are there any ongoing investigations to like contacts of contacts? Any other workplaces needing to be scrutinized?  How many others may be out there? Dr McElnay: Auckland Regional Public Health have been actively following up further investigations from the two identified and reported today.  The focus to date has been around the port and the ships and the original case that we reported over the weekend.  The two ships that that case had been on.  So they are actively following those up.  With testing, we are taking a very proactive approach to contacts of contacts and we have certainly reiterated that message to Auckland Regional Public Health. Media: Family members of port workers, presumably they operate outside the port environment in the community.  Is there concern about that? Dr Bloomfield: There is not and I tell you why not.  Just to reiterate this is a very small company of four employees, it is not actually based at the port.  And so the only interaction that those workers have, even though they are described as port workers they are not based at the port – they work on the ships and the only interaction they really have at the port is with the security guards as they go through and straight to the ships.  Hence the focus on workplace contacts in the small workplace with four people and the ships and others who might have worked on the ships, particularly the one that is now in Brisbane, so the pilot and any stevedores that were involved in the work on that ship when it was in New Zealand, they have also been stood down and tested. Media: Many nurses that Newshub has spoken to have left their jobs in managed isolation sites after the DHB took over, they say their current shortages are dangerous for staff and internal documents confirm there is a shortage.  Do you have any concerns about this? Dr Bloomfield: I don’t, and I don’t share the same view, and in fact, if I give an example, across the managed isolation facilities in Auckland there are 175 nurses and health care assistants that work across there.  At the moment, as of last week actually, there were 120 of those employed by the DHBs and presumably they had taken up that role because they were comfortable with the work there.  There was still an arrangement in place to use 55 agency staff, that is Geneva, the company that has been involved right from the start in Auckland, so the DHB is moving to recruit to a fully DHB-employed workforce.  They are great people who are doing excellent work to help keep New Zealand safe. Media: We have been told of that the current claim - that nurse numbers is not safe and sufficient is not true and that nurses are burnt out.  What evidence do you have to suggest all is going well? Dr Bloomfield: I have great confidence in my colleague Margie Apa who is the Chief Executive of Counties Manukau District Heath Board and her team who are overseeing the clinical supervision and the clinical support of the nursing and the health care staff who work at quarantine facilities and managed care isolation.  What I do know is that if there are any issues they would be open to hearing those and to acting promptly on any of those issues. Media: Do you have any update on the crew of the ?? in Hawke’s Bay? Dr Bloomfield: That ship is still off-shore.  At the moment we are still considering them as close contacts and Caroline has got the latest information. Dr McElnay: Yes, because the port worker was on that ship during his infectious period as the people on that ship, we don’t consider them to be the source of the infection but we do consider that they have been close contacts so they are receiving daily checks, so that is underway, that has been happening since the weekend.  The ship is still off the coast at Napier, and we are just waiting on updates from the shipping company around where the ship will move to next. Media: Is there any concern? Dr McElnay: No, they are all symptom free. Dr Bloomfield: I think just the other comment to make on that is even if they are not tested in that fourteen day period, if they subsequently want to come on shore, anyone who comes on shore will require the whole crew to be tested and to get a test and to test negative. Media: How confident are you that you have got it contained now or not? Dr Bloomfield: Well it is contained in the sense that they are all in a managed isolation facility.  I would be surprised if we don’t find more cases either at the testing tomorrow or on day twelve, and whether those are acute or historical will be the important thing.  That is why we are testing at day six as an interim measure and then of course once we have got any results from that if that requires further testing or extension of that managed isolation period that will be one of the decisions that will be considered. Media: Is there any chance that it could be through the whole crew. That it has reached that point? Dr Bloomfield: No I don’t think so, because remember that once they have arrived in the facility even though they might be sharing rooms, there are very strict protocols in there and they are very carefully supervised and we have reports that there is a high level of compliance there.  And that is exactly why we have those arrangements in place. Media: We have been told that there are no dedicated swabbing teams any more.  On duty nurses are expected to do health checks and swabbing.  Is this a problem? Dr Bloomfield: No I don’t think it’s a problem. Media: Last week or maybe the week before there were a group of academics that released a statement.  Do you have any comment on that? Dr Bloomfield: Yes, I do know a bit about the statement and at the same time I have seen a bit of very credible and prominent public health leaders from around the globe take a compelling I think and opposing view.  And again I think the extent to which New Zealand has been successful in using lockdowns for a defined time and for the shortest time possible which a number of countries have done successfully, including Australia, and there are many others, I think is testament to the fact that lockdowns can and should play a place where necessary as part of a response.  But just to reiterate, the WHO view on this, which is not the first tool you should reach for in the bag, but in New Zealand as we have learnt more and more our strength and our border approach around testing, contact tracing, isolation, part of the reason for that is the less use of lockdowns in the future and I think with our management of the last two or three community-based infections, that is possible, and other countries have shown the same.  Did you want to comment Caroline? Dr McElnay: No Dr Bloomfield: She agrees with me. Media: The other ship that has been stopped from docking in Australia until we know more, you have said that is the likely source of infection.  Do we know any more about when we get more information about that.  Do you have ongoing discussions with Australia? Dr Bloomfield: Very intense discussions with Australia.  It is actually in Australia in Brisbane.  It got there two evenings ago.  The crew, all nineteen, have been tested.  We are just awaiting the results.  They are a couple of hours behind us timewise but I hope, I think people will recognise Queensland is one of the states that has got very strict internal border arrangements and restrictions and so they are obviously very keen to ensure that no-one in that crew is likely to be infectious and if they have positive results they will be genome sequencing to see if we can get a match with the cases that we have got here. Media: So will it be today or tomorrow that we will know the results of those? Dr Bloomfield: I would expect today and once we find out we will make that information available. Media: You have outlined previously why that seems to be contained and you see no immediate change to level or restrictions, what would need to happen for you to recommend that move? Dr Bloomfield: Well I think a move to level two would have been something that we might have advised when we first found the case if we were not clear where it had come from or if we had found some other cases coming out that we weren’t aware of but in this case we have a really strong line of inquiry for where this person might have become infected and we were able to identify very quickly their close contacts and isolate those people.  So, I think that is the system working as it should in the community. Media: So if the tests all come back negative, and you don’t see any link to that, does that scare you? Dr Bloomfield: Yes that is something that we discussed earlier on.  I mean, we will cross that bridge but it seems that in terms of timing and nature of the sub-type of the virus which is not one we’ve had in New Zealand before, it is not a common one from Australia or the UK, or the USA, it seems that that is almost certainly the most likely source of the infection. Dr McElnay: Just to add to that, every case has its own case investigation and it may be that the case that we reported today that had a common exposure to the one reported over the weekend and had gone to the same ship, it may be that there is something else in that individual’s history that gives us a stronger line of inquiry, those are the sorts of questions that Regional Public Health will be going over today just in case it looks like the Sofrana is not the source of infection. Media: Does it shine any more light for you on the Americold case that this is the possible source of infection for the three ships Dr Bloomfield: No it doesn’t shine any more light on that.  What it does confirm is that the virus can come in through anywhere in the border at any point in time and that is why we have continually strengthened our arrangements including the very now well-established surveillance testing of workers at sea ports and at airports.

Last month the New Zealand Government agreed to buy enough of the Pfizer BioNTech product to vaccinate 750,000 people. If Medsafe approves the vaccine for use in New Zealand, it is possible that some doses will be available here in the first part of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech will keep us up to date on when data will be available for Medsafe to begin its evaluation process. Medsafe is working to ensure any promising vaccines will be fully assessed as quickly as possible against the same criteria used for all other medicines that enter New Zealand. This is just the first of several expected vaccine purchases which will create a portfolio of vaccine options for New Zealand. The COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce, led by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, is working with COVAX to access vaccines and negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies. Further announcements are expected this month. The Ministry of Health is developing the process for rolling out vaccines as they become available and the approach will be finalised once the features of vaccines and the supply is understood. Three broad groups are being considered: those at risk of spreading COVID-19 those at risk of contracting the virus those with increased risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19. The government has set aside $66.3 million for medical supplies and infrastructure to ensure New Zealand is ready to launch a COVID-19 Immunisation Programme as soon as a safe and effective vaccine is available. COVID-19 vaccines in New Zealand
The Government has made an in-principle agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica to buy up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. The agreement with Janssen is for up to 2 million vaccine doses from July 2021. There is also an option to buy up to 3 million more doses that will be delivered throughout 2022. The Janssen vaccine is likely to be a single dose, which may be more efficient to administer than other vaccine options. Janssen and its parent company Johnson & Johnson have a very strong history of producing safe and effective pharmaceutical products, giving us confidence they will develop, manufacture and deliver a safe and effective vaccine. We are working to make sure that extra agreements are in place to complete the vaccine portfolio. Our main priority is to make sure every New Zealander has access to safe and effective vaccines. Any COVID-19 vaccine used in Aotearoa must be approved by Medsafe. Safety will always be the priority — Medsafe will make sure any vaccine meets internationally agreed criteria for safety, efficacy and quality. This criteria includes data from well-designed clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people. Find out more about our vaccine strategy
If you are sick, do not travel or socialise this Labour weekend. If you are sick with cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate. This means you should not travel, and you should not go out to Labour weekend sales or other social or retail events. Instead, stay home and call your GP or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 to get a COVID-19 test. --- Section Separator --- Wherever you go and whatever you do over Labour weekend, record it. The NZ COVID Tracer app keeps us one step ahead of the virus. The more we all scan, the safer we’ll all be. If you see a QR code, scan it. This is particularly important as many people may be moving around the country, and you may not remember later the names and places of everywhere you visit if you are away from home. Even if you have fallen out of the habit of using the app, we urge you to start again — reset your habits and go from now. Businesses have a part to play as well. Make sure your QR code can be easily seen and accessed, and encourage people to scan in. If you do not use the app, remember to keep a pen and paper diary of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen. --- Section Separator --- When travelling, you are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering on public transport or planes, or when you cannot maintain physical distance in crowded indoor places. --- Section Separator --- Make sure you’re washing your hands regularly, keeping surfaces clean, coughing and sneezing into your elbow and wearing face coverings when you can’t maintain physical distance in crowded indoor spaces.
The case, reported to the Ministry on Monday afternoon, is a staff member working in a managed isolation facility in Christchurch where the international mariners are in managed isolation and quarantine. Full details of the case, and the actions taken in response will be provided at a 1pm media conference on Tuesday 3 November. The individual was tested as part of the routine testing for staff in the facility and returned a negative test on Thursday 29 October.  On Saturday, they developed symptoms and sought a further test on Sunday. A positive result was received today. The person is now in isolation at home and reports taking care to isolate themselves as soon as they developed symptoms. Advice if you’re in Canterbury region The first of the international mariners, due to complete their managed isolation on Tuesday morning, will have their managed isolation extended for at least 24 hours as an additional precautionary measure. Those precautionary measures have included additional tests — up to 4 tests for some individuals — and an already lengthened stay in managed isolation.
From 11:59pm on Wednesday 18 November, face coverings legally must be worn: on all public transport to, from and through Auckland on domestic flights throughout New Zealand by Auckland taxi and ride-share drivers — while it’s not compulsory for passengers to wear them, we strongly encourage you to. Children under the age of 12 will be exempt, as will people with certain medical conditions. Students will not need to wear masks on school buses, but drivers will be required to. A face covering helps stop droplets spreading when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. This includes someone who has COVID-19 but feels well or has no obvious symptoms. Wear a face covering
A person, now confirmed with COVID-19, was infectious while in the pub between 7:30pm and 10pm on Friday 16 October. The person is one of the cases announced by the Ministry of Health today. If you who scanned the NZ COVID Tracer QR code at The Malt during this evening, you should receive a notification. This will confirm you were there at the same time as the case. --- Section Separator --- If you were at The Malt in Greenhithe during this time you should now self-isolate and get tested. Staff will also be asked to get tested. You should stay at home in self-isolation until you receive a negative test result. If you were at the pub that night and get sick, even after a negative test result, you should self-isolate again and get tested again. There will be a pop-up community testing centre in the Greenhithe area from Thursday 22 October. The location and times are available on the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) website.

Latest information on managed isolation charges (external link) --- Section Separator --- The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to only charge New Zealanders who enter temporarily, or who leave New Zealand after regulations come into force. Temporary visa holders would have to pay unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand before the border closure, and left before the border closure. --- Section Separator --- The Bill will provide a legal framework to allow the Government to set payment terms, exempt groups of people and waive charges in cases of financial hardship. It will also ensure that: recovered charges do not exceed the actual costs of managed isolation and quarantine no upfront payment would be required there would be flexibility in how people could pay. Check the progress of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill through Parliament (external link) --- Section Separator --- The proposed charging structure for managed isolation and quarantine will be: $3,100 per person in a room $950 for each additional adult, and $475 for each additional child sharing the room. The system has been designed so that it is fair on arrivals and not a barrier for returning to New Zealand, especially for those who might already be experiencing financial stress. It is forecast that more people will be travelling and arriving at the border. The Government has set aside a total of $479 million to pay for the costs of managed isolation facilities until the end of the year. Further details of the charging scheme, and when it will come into force, will be announced soon. --- Section Separator --- Once the regulations come into force, it is proposed New Zealanders, residents and temporary visa holders will have to pay charges: Any New Zealander, who either: leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force, or is visiting New Zealand for less than 90 days. leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force, or is visiting New Zealand for less than 90 days. Any temporary visa holder, unless: they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand as of 19 March 2020, and they departed New Zealand on or before 19 March 2020, and they are not entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker. they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand as of 19 March 2020, and they departed New Zealand on or before 19 March 2020, and they are not entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker. Flowchart: Proposed liability for managed isolation and quarantine charges [PDF, 216 KB] --- Section Separator --- Classes of people, such as the following, are proposed not to be liable for charges: Family members travelling or isolating with people who do not have to pay charges (unless they are entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker). New Zealand citizens deported to New Zealand. Diplomats and official government representatives. Any person travelling to New Zealand to attend the sentencing of the accused in the Christchurch mosque attacks. Refugees and protected persons for their first entry into New Zealand after the charges come into force. Flowchart: Proposed liability for managed isolation and quarantine charges [PDF, 216 KB] --- Section Separator --- New Zealanders who are currently overseas (that is, who left before the regulations come into force) will not have to pay if they stay in New Zealand for 90 days or longer. If you leave New Zealand after the regulations come into force, it is proposed that you would have to pay for your managed isolation unless you qualify for a waiver or are otherwise exempt. Anyone who needs to come home but cannot afford the charges, will still be able to come home. It is proposed that regulations allow the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment to waive charges in full or in part if they consider that undue financial hardship will be caused by the payment of the charges, or in any circumstances (which could include compassionate grounds) for which they consider a full or partial waiver appropriate. This will allow the chief executive to take into consideration an individual’s full circumstances. Final decisions on this will be announced soon. --- Section Separator --- It is impossible to tell how the situation develops internationally and in New Zealand. Our priority is keeping New Zealand safe. The Government is working to make the system sustainable and manageable for as long as we need it and it is expected the system will be amended as appropriate. --- Section Separator --- Our experience from February and March 2020, before managed isolation and quarantine was introduced, showed that compliance with self-isolation requirements by people arriving in New Zealand was patchy and could not be relied on. Final decisions on this will be announced soon.
The Ministry of Health is confirming 1 new case of COVID-19 in a worker in the Auckland quarantine facility. Because the person works at the facility and is not a returnee they are considered a community case. The case was reported to the Ministry on Friday afternoon. The individual has been tested regularly as part of the routine testing for staff in the facility, most recently being swabbed on 3 November and returning a negative test on 4 November. The staff member developed symptoms on 5 November and was tested again that day. That test has returned a positive result. Contacts of the worker are being traced, isolated and tested. Two businesses in Auckland have been contacted by Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) and notified that the worker visited their premises during their infectious period. A push notification has been sent via NZ COVID Tracer to everyone who scanned in to these businesses around the relevant time. Advice if you're in Auckland Full details of the case, and the actions taken in response to the positive result, will be provided in the 1pm update on Saturday. Managed isolation workers are regularly tested.  As in other recent cases this worker quickly got tested as soon as they became aware of symptoms. The early identification of cases along with rapid contact tracing assists in stopping any spread of the virus.

The person is a close workplace contact of the case reported yesterday. As the person works at the facility and is not a returnee they are treated as a community case. Both this case, and the one reported on Monday, came into contact with the international mariners in the course of their duties, including some of the 31 mariners who have tested positive to COVID-19 and who remain in quarantine. The individual was tested as part of the routine testing for staff in the facility and returned a negative test on Thursday 29 October. They are asymptomatic and were retested after being identified as being a close work contact of the case reported on Monday and a positive result was received today. The person is now in isolation at home and transfer is being arranged to a managed isolation facility. The initial assessment is that there are only 2 close contacts of this current case, both household contacts, both are now being tested and both are in isolation at home. At this stage the Ministry is not advising of any need to change the current approach. Both cases have limited numbers of contacts and the incident is currently well contained. The first of the international mariners, due to complete their managed isolation this morning, have had their managed isolation extended for at least a further 48 hours as an additional precautionary measure while further information from the current round of staff testing is gathered. Those precautionary measures have included additional tests — up to 4 tests for some individuals — and an already lengthened stay in managed isolation. The genome sequencing of the case announced on Monday is not expected to be completed until this evening and will be reported tomorrow. Further details of the case if available, and the actions taken in response will be provided tomorrow at a 1pm media conference. Advice if you’re in Canterbury region

The proposed Bluetooth contact tracing card, sometimes called the CovidCard, is now being trialled in Ngongotahā, just outside Rotorua. Between 500 and 1,500 members of the Ngongotahā community will participate in the trial. Registration began on 30 October, and the trial will finish on 15 November. Participants will be asked to wear the cards as they go about their daily activities and attend community events. The cards use Bluetooth to exchange “digital handshakes” and will keep an anonymised record of participants’ close contact with each other. The trial will help the Ministry of Health understand how well the contact tracing cards perform in a real-world scenario, whether they work with our contact tracing systems, and if people will accept and use them. The results of the trial will help the Government decide if we should use contact tracing cards alongside the NZ COVID Tracer app to support contact tracing. This phase of the trial was co-designed by the Ministry of Health, Te Arawa COVID-19 Response Hub and the Universities of Waikato and Otago. Te Arawa knows the Ngongotahā community better than anyone and has the skills and experience needed to support a successful community trial. Find out more about the trial, and register to participate if you live in Ngongotahā (external link)
1 case was detected in a recent returnee in a managed isolation facility. They have been moved to the Auckland quarantine facility. 2 new cases in the community. --- Section Separator --- Updated 6.15pm, Thursday 12 November --- Section Separator --- The Ministry of Health has reported a community case in Auckland. A detailed interview with the case has been conducted by Auckland Regional Public Health Service. They have now been moved to the Auckland quarantine facility today. We have identified 3 close contacts, and they are all being followed up, isolated, and tested. Close contacts include a colleague of the case, and 2 friends. They all report being well. The 2 friends are being transferred to the Auckland quarantine facility as a precaution. 1 of the friends lives alone in the Vincent Residences, the same as the case. Following interviews with the case, Health authorities are in the process of confirming a number of locations of interest that the person visited while possibly infectious. Check if you have visited a location of interest If you work in central Auckland, we are asking you to work from home where possible. If you must go into this area, please use masks and maintain physical distance while health authorities continue work to trace the source of this infection. Advice if you’re in Auckland There have been media reports around a fire alarm at the managed isolation facility at the Grand Millennium that saw returnees on the street near today’s case’s accommodation. The fire alarm was 8pm on Monday 9 November. This is not likely to be a source of infection for this case because she was already symptomatic earlier that day. --- Section Separator --- 1 community case is connected to the November quarantine cluster — Case C. They are a close contact of Case B and tested positive on 11 November. Case C met Case B for lunch in Wellington at the Little Penang restaurant on The Terrace on Friday afternoon. On developing symptoms on Saturday they self-isolated at home and had a COVID-19 test. Although initially returning a negative result on day 3, they were moved to quarantine at the Grand Mercure in Wellington as a precaution on Tuesday. A second test yesterday resulted in a positive result. Push notifications were sent out on Sunday for Little Penang The Terrace, which was visited by Case B and Case C. Anyone who visited the restaurant between 1pm and 4pm on Friday should have a test if they feel symptomatic. Household contacts for Case C are in isolation and have returned negative results. All identified close contacts are also isolating. Advice if you live in Wellington
There are 4 cases of COVID-19 to report in New Zealand today. They are all in managed isolation. 1 case is a recent arrival and 3 are classified as historical. --- Section Separator --- The new community case has been linked to the Auckland managed isolation worker. Test results of the new case's 3 close contacts have come back negative. Now that we have this information, we can have greater assurance around the source of this community transmission. The Ministry of Health is now working with public health officials in Auckland, to investigate how the 2 cases are linked. This includes reviewing their movements, people they may have met, or places they may have visited. Everyone in Auckland is strongly encouraged to wear a face covering on public transport. The more we scan, the safer we’ll be. Continue using the NZ COVID Tracer app and scan the QR codes at the places you visit. Advice if you’re in Auckland Following interviews with the case, public health officials have confirmed locations of interest that cases have visited while possibly infectious. People who visited these locations in Auckland should get a test — even if they have no symptoms. Check if you have visited a location of interest There are additional testing locations open throughout Auckland. Testing locations in Auckland (external link) You should get tested if you: have visited a location of interest, or have cold, flu, or COVID-19 symptoms.

The disease is contained in New Zealand, but uncontrolled overseas. It is safe for all business to operate as normal. It is safe for events and activities to go ahead. Controls exist at the borders to address the risk of importing COVID-19, and keep New Zealand safe. All people arriving in New Zealand are required to stay in a managed isolation or quarantine facility for at least 14 days and test negative for COVID-19. Other than the border measures there are no other restrictions in place for New Zealanders. There is a robust system in place to safely welcome New Zealanders home, while keeping our communities protected. You have a legal right to come home if you are: a New Zealand citizen a New Zealand resident with valid travel conditions. People from any other countries are unable to enter New Zealand at this time, unless they have specific grounds for exemption, such as being essential workers or for medical reasons. These people will need to apply to Immigration New Zealand for an exception to the border closure. Immigration NZ has the most up to date information on the border exception criteria and process (external link) Those returning to New Zealand must do their part to stop COVID-19 spreading in New Zealand. All arrivals must complete 14 days of managed isolation or quarantine and test negative for COVID-19 before they can enter the community. People without symptoms will isolate at a managed isolation facility, and those with symptoms or who test positive will isolate in a quarantine facility or separate area. Managed Isolation and Quarantine (external link) Carrying out managed isolation and quarantine throughout regions across New Zealand is a key part of our border management. All facilities used for isolation or quarantine are closely monitored to make sure all the measures are in place to keep New Zealand safe. New Zealand currently has managed isolation facilities in: Auckland Christchurch Rotorua Wellington Hamilton None of the hotels being used as managed isolation facilities are currently open to domestic travellers or guests — they are exclusive to people who have recently arrived in New Zealand. These facilities are operating safely and are carefully managed with security. The hotels are stand-alone facilities — there are no shared public spaces with other members of the community. In total there are more than 500 government and contracted staff directly supporting managed isolation and quarantine. Each quarantine and managed isolation facility has an All of Government support team. Each team works alongside facility management to support the health, wellbeing, security, supplementary logistics and administration of the people staying in the facility. The teams vary in size depending on facility capacity, and include people from the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Defence Force, Police, Aviation Security, and the Ministry of Social Development. Managed isolation and quarantine facilities meet a strict set of criteria to ensure people staying and working in them are kept safe, and that there’s a safe transition of people back into the community after their isolation period. Hotels are chosen based on demand and suitability. Selection includes an assessment by the national Isolation, Quarantine and Repatriation team, and site visits from our on-the-ground teams in the respective locations. Hotels must meet a range of criteria including security, entry/exit points, suitable room and bathroom facilities, provision of food and drink delivered to rooms, safe laundry protocols, and the ability to ensure the wellbeing of people. People arriving in New Zealand need to complete their at least 14-days stay in a managed isolation or quarantine facility to ensure they can return safely to their family and friends. People will be tested for COVID-19 around days three and 12 of their stay. They must also have a negative test before they are released. Managed isolation facilities are closely monitored to make sure all measures needed to keep the local community safe are in place. None of the facilities have shared spaces with the public or wider community. There is a robust process in place if a potential case is identified in an isolation facility, including isolation of any close or casual contacts. You may see staff on the ground in the community who work at managed isolation facilities. These people are following all public health guidance. People who are in managed isolation cannot leave the hotel until they complete 14 days and return a negative COVID-19 test. For everyone else, it is safe to be out and about in the community as normal. It is safe for all business to operate as normal. It is safe for events and activities to go ahead. Other than the border measures, including managed isolation and quarantine, there are no other restrictions in place for New Zealanders.

Latest information on managed isolation charges (external link) --- Section Separator --- The Bill allowing the Government to recover some costs for managed isolation and quarantine passed its third reading today, and the charges will come into force as soon as regulations are finalised. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill and its supporting regulations will introduce a new charging system for managed isolation to balance the rights of New Zealanders to return home and help reduce pressure on the system. The proposed charges are: $3,100 for the first person in the room $950 for each additional adult sharing the room $475 for each additional child (aged 3 to 17 years) sharing that room. There will be no charge for children under the age of 3. These charges are GST inclusive. Any New Zealander who is currently overseas and enters New Zealand after the regulations come into force for less than 90 days will be liable for charges, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Any New Zealander who leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force (for example for a holiday or business) will be liable for charges when they return, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Everyone entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker will have to pay. In many cases, their employers will pay their managed isolation and quarantine costs. Other temporary visa holders are liable for the charges, unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand at the time the border closed and departed New Zealand on or before 19 March 2020. Charging will start soon after the regulations come into force. This will happen after the Bill is given Royal Assent. The start date of the charging regime will be published on www.miq.govt.nz (external link) as soon as it is confirmed. The following exemptions are proposed: Partners, dependent children and legal guardians who are isolating or travelling with someone who is exempt from paying charges, unless they are entering under a critical worker border exception. Someone in New Zealand who goes into managed isolation to care for a person who is exempt from charges. Anyone travelling to New Zealand to attend the sentencing of the person convicted of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Refugees, including claimants, protected persons and applicants under the special immigration category for victims of domestic violence, when they enter New Zealand for the first time. Anyone entering New Zealand after a medical air transfer or rescue at sea. Patients travelling as part of the Ministry of Health High Cost Treatment Pool or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade New Zealand Medical Treatment Scheme. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau who are travelling to New Zealand for medical treatment. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau, travelling from a third country through New Zealand (staying less than 90 days) in order to return to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (staying at least 90 days). People being deported to New Zealand, defined as “returning offenders” (in the Returning Offenders (Management and Information) Act 2015) and any New Zealand citizen deported from Australia. Diplomats and consular staff, including their families, and official government representatives. Waiver applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is proposed that waivers will be available in cases of undue financial hardship and other special circumstances. These special circumstances could include: a New Zealander entering managed isolation because they left New Zealand to accompany a vulnerable or disabled person back to New Zealand someone needing to travel to or from New Zealand to receive medical treatment other compassionate grounds, including when a person has travelled to visit a seriously ill or dying close relative or attend a funeral or tangihanga, whether in New Zealand or overseas. People will be able to apply for waivers once the regulations are in force. Information about the process will be available on www.miq.govt.nz at that time. Returnees who need to pay will get an invoice at the end of their stay in managed isolation and will generally have 90 days to pay. Information about how to pay the fee will be provided on the invoice.
