Home COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccine boosters Boosters provide an extra layer of protection to your previous vaccination and keep your immunity levels high. Booster doses use the Pfizer BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine. --- Section Separator --- Regardless of how many boosters you have had, you can get an additional booster now if you are: aged 30 and over pregnant, and aged 16 or over aged 12 to 29 and at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 . --- Section Separator --- Having COVID-19 does not provide the same level of immunity as getting vaccinated. We also know that your protection from the primary course (this is usually 2 doses) of the vaccine decreases over time. To keep your immunity levels high, stay up to date with your vaccinations — including boosters. This will lower your chances of getting very sick from COVID-19 and ending up in hospital. For boosters, we use the Pfizer BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine. This is an updated vaccine targeting Omicron. COVID-19 vaccines are free. The bivalent vaccine produces an immune response against the original virus and Omicron variants. Specifically the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Current evidence indicates the bivalent vaccine is more effective against Omicron subvariants than earlier vaccines. If you do not want the bivalent vaccine, you can ask for the original Pfizer vaccine when you arrive for your vaccination. --- Section Separator --- If you are 30 years of age and over, you can have a booster regardless of the number of boosters you have already had. You can have a booster if: you have had your first 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (your primary course) it is recommended you wait at least 6 months since you had COVID-19 it is recommended you wait at least 6 months since you had any other COVID-19 vaccine. Boosters are especially recommended for: all people over 65 years old Māori and Pacific people aged 50 and over pregnant people with health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 people with disability with significant or complex health needs people with serious mental health conditions young people aged 12 to 15 who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 — talk to your usual doctor, nurse or healthcare provider about whether this is recommended and how to get a prescription. --- Section Separator --- Healthy people aged 16 to 29 can have a 1 booster dose. To get a booster: you must have had at least your first 2 COVID-19 vaccinations, and it is recommended you wait at least 6 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection. Some people aged 16 to 29 can have an additional booster dose. This includes: severely immunocompromised people pregnant people those who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 those who live with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities. --- Section Separator --- Healthy children under 16 years old are not eligible for boosters. Young people aged 12 to 15 who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 can get a booster dose on prescription. Talk to your doctor, nurse, or healthcare provider about whether this is recommended and how to get a prescription. --- Section Separator --- Children under the age of 12 cannot get a booster. You can talk to your doctor, nurse or healthcare provider about your child's specific circumstances. Children have a good immune response and are much less likely to have a severe illness and need to go to hospital if they get COVID-19. --- Section Separator --- You can check the date of your last vaccination in My Covid Record.

Home Current phase of our COVID-19 response With overall COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalisations trending downwards, along with a highly vaccinated population and increased access to antiviral medicines, the last remaining mandatory COVID-19 requirements have been removed. What you need to know If you have COVID-19 How to self-isolate Household Contacts Get free RATs Face masks International travel Close Contacts Antivirals --- Section Separator --- Thanks to the efforts of New Zealanders throughout the pandemic, we have saved thousands of lives. As well as each person and family who has followed the rules, we thank all those who have made extraordinary efforts to protect people and communities, including iwi and Māori health providers Pacific organisations aged care providers businesses schools and other education providers. --- Section Separator --- Stay at home if you are feeling unwell. If you, or someone in your household develops 1 or more of the following symptoms, you should take a rapid antigen test (RAT): a runny nose sore throat cough fever vomiting diarrhoea headache loss of smell or taste shortness of breath. It is important to make sure you have enough RATs at home in case anyone in the household becomes unwell and needs to test. RATs will remain free for everyone throughout 2023. You can find out participating pick-up points for RATs and masks on the Healthpoint website, or by calling 0800 222 478 and choosing option 1. COVID-19 Testing • Healthpoint (external link) Remember to report your RAT result on My Covid Record, or call the helpline on 0800 222 478 and choose option 1, so you can be connected with any help and support you might need. My Covid Record (external link) Isolation is an important way to manage the spread of the virus. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, we recommend you isolate for 5 days, even if you only have mild symptoms. Start your isolation from the day your symptoms started or when you tested positive, whichever came first. This means you should not go to work or school. How to self-isolate If you do need to leave your home during these 5 days, it is very important you take precautions to prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.  You should wear a mask whenever you leave the house. You should not: visit a healthcare facility (except to access medical care) visit an aged residential care facility have contact with anyone at risk of getting seriously unwell with COVID-19. You should discuss your return to work with your employer or your child’s return to school with their school principal. Your employer or school may require additional precautions. If you are in isolation at the time of the setting change announcement, we recommend you continue isolating until you have completed 5 days. If you have already been isolating for 6 or 7 days, and are well, you can return to your normal activities. If your symptoms have resolved and you feel well, you can return to your normal activities. Because you can remain infectious for up to 10 days, we recommend you wear a mask if you need to visit: a healthcare facility (except to access medical care) an aged residential care facility anyone at risk of getting seriously unwell with COVID-19. Facilities may continue to require all staff or visitors to wear masks regardless of whether they have recently had COVID-19. Wearing a face mask If you, or a household member, test positive for COVID-19, other people living with you are also at higher risk of becoming infected. We recommend all household contacts continue to test with a RAT from the day the person with COVID-19 tests positive. You are considered to be a household contact if you live with, or have spent at least 1 night or day (more than 8 hours) with someone who has COVID-19.  Household contacts should test daily for 5 days using a RAT. Household Contacts Antiviral medicines are available for people at risk of becoming very sick with COVID-19, including: Māori or Pacific people aged 50 or over everyone aged 65 or over anyone aged 50 or over with fewer than 2 COVID-19 vaccinations anyone with a severely weakened immune system anyone with Down syndrome anyone with sickle cell disease anyone who has previously been in critical high dependency hospital care from COVID-19 anyone with 3 or more high-risk medical conditions.

The Bill allowing the Government to recover some costs for managed isolation and quarantine passed its third reading today, and the charges will come into force as soon as regulations are finalised. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill and its supporting regulations will introduce a new charging system for managed isolation to balance the rights of New Zealanders to return home and help reduce pressure on the system. The proposed charges are: $3,100 for the first person in the room $950 for each additional adult sharing the room $475 for each additional child (aged 3 to 17 years) sharing that room. There will be no charge for children under the age of 3. These charges are GST inclusive. Any New Zealander who is currently overseas and enters New Zealand after the regulations come into force for less than 90 days will be liable for charges, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Any New Zealander who leaves New Zealand after the regulations come into force (for example for a holiday or business) will be liable for charges when they return, unless they are exempt or qualify for a waiver. Everyone entering New Zealand on a border exception as a critical worker will have to pay. In many cases, their employers will pay their managed isolation and quarantine costs. Other temporary visa holders are liable for the charges, unless they were ordinarily resident in New Zealand at the time the border closed and departed New Zealand on or before 19 March 2020. Charging will start soon after the regulations come into force. This will happen after the Bill is given Royal Assent. The start date of the charging regime will be published on www.miq.govt.nz (external link) as soon as it is confirmed. The following exemptions are proposed: Partners, dependent children and legal guardians who are isolating or travelling with someone who is exempt from paying charges, unless they are entering under a critical worker border exception. Someone in New Zealand who goes into managed isolation to care for a person who is exempt from charges. Anyone travelling to New Zealand to attend the sentencing of the person convicted of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Refugees, including claimants, protected persons and applicants under the special immigration category for victims of domestic violence, when they enter New Zealand for the first time. Anyone entering New Zealand after a medical air transfer or rescue at sea. Patients travelling as part of the Ministry of Health High Cost Treatment Pool or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade New Zealand Medical Treatment Scheme. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau who are travelling to New Zealand for medical treatment. New Zealand citizens ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau, travelling from a third country through New Zealand (staying less than 90 days) in order to return to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (staying at least 90 days). People being deported to New Zealand, defined as “returning offenders” (in the Returning Offenders (Management and Information) Act 2015) and any New Zealand citizen deported from Australia. Diplomats and consular staff, including their families, and official government representatives. Waiver applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is proposed that waivers will be available in cases of undue financial hardship and other special circumstances. These special circumstances could include: a New Zealander entering managed isolation because they left New Zealand to accompany a vulnerable or disabled person back to New Zealand someone needing to travel to or from New Zealand to receive medical treatment other compassionate grounds, including when a person has travelled to visit a seriously ill or dying close relative or attend a funeral or tangihanga, whether in New Zealand or overseas. People will be able to apply for waivers once the regulations are in force. Information about the process will be available on www.miq.govt.nz at that time. Returnees who need to pay will get an invoice at the end of their stay in managed isolation and will generally have 90 days to pay.

Home Prepare and stay safe About COVID-19 Infection and immunity --- Section Separator --- How infectious someone is may depend on a range of factors, such as how sick they are and how their immune system responds to the virus. If you get COVID-19, you are likely to be infectious from 48 hours before the onset of symptoms until 24 hours after your symptoms have ended. Some people who have tested positive for COVID-19 can still be infectious for up to 10 days. Sometimes people may have COVID-19, but not have any symptoms. These people may still be infectious. Some people may test positive for COVID-19 after they have recovered and no longer have symptoms. They are unlikely to be infectious beyond 24 hours after their symptoms have ended. If you have COVID-19 When you get SARS-CoV2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — your immune system kicks in and produces an immune response. Your immune system starts creating proteins called antibodies. These antibodies fight the virus. Antibodies can remember what a virus looks like, which means that your immune system can spot and target the virus if you get it again. The immune system then destroys the virus. This process is like what happens when your body encounters other common viruses, such as the flu. While our body can produce an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we do not know how long this immunity lasts. Initial research shows that antibody responses can last for several months in some people. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine produces the same immune response without you getting the virus. Vaccines give your body a head start so when you are exposed to the virus, your body already knows how to fight it. COVID-19 vaccines It is possible to test for antibodies in the blood if a person has had COVID-19 before. This is an antibody or serology test. Antibody testing may be helpful for finding out whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past but it is not helpful for diagnosing new infections. This is because your body takes a few weeks to make antibodies after catching a virus. Antibody testing is not available publicly on request in New Zealand. It is only used in limited cases at the direction of a public health doctor. This is to support the investigation of possible new cases or to support patient management. Antibodies attack 2 different parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are: the spike protein on the surface of the virus the shell of the virus, also known as the nucleocapsid. Your body produces 3 different types of antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, to work against the 2 parts of the virus. They are: IgM IgG IgA. These 3 antibodies can be detected within 1 to 3 weeks after you have COVID-19. IgM and IgG antibodies can be made at the same time. IgM and IgA antibodies decay more rapidly than IgG. We know that: IgG antibodies made after having COVID-19 can be detected 2 or more weeks after symptoms began. Not everyone produces IgG antibodies when they get COVID-19. But they may still develop immunity. Studies show IgG antibodies can last for several months after you have COVID-19. But it is still unknown how long immunity may last. As with other viral tests, antibody testing can have false-positive and false-negative results. These tests should only be used in appropriate situations and the results need to be interpreted carefully. The latest evidence shows that getting reinfected with COVID-19 can happen within a short period of time. Reinfection will become more likely as new variants spread in the community. If you get new COVID-19 symptoms and it has been more than 29 days since your previous infection, it is possible you have a new infection and should get a test. It is unclear how common reinfection is with COVID-19. We are monitoring international and national data and will update guidance as new evidence is available.

Home Prepare and stay safe About COVID-19 COVID-19 symptoms --- Section Separator --- Symptoms can include one or more of the following: a new or worsening cough sneezing and runny nose a fever temporary loss of smell or altered sense of taste sore throat shortness of breath (this is a sign of possible pneumonia and requires immediate attention) fatigue/feeling of tiredness. Less common symptoms may include: diarrhoea headache muscle pain or body aches nausea vomiting malaise — a general feeling of discomfort, illness or unease chest pain abdominal pain joint pain confusion or irritability. These less common symptoms almost always occur with one or more of the common symptoms. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have COVID-19. The symptoms are like other illnesses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor, Healthline on 0800 358 5453 or your iwi health provider. If you get symptoms with COVID-19, you are likely to get them within 3 days of infection. But it could take up to 8 days after infection. Sometimes people may have COVID-19, but not have any symptoms. Some people with COVID-19 can pass it on to others 1 or 2 days before showing symptoms. If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms, stay home and get a rapid antigen test (RAT) as soon as you start to feel unwell. Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can be connected with any help and support you might need. For advice, call: your doctor or nurse Healthline for free on 0800 222 478 and choose option 1 your iwi health provider, or a community-based testing location if you are outside New Zealand, call +64 9 358 5453 or your doctor. How to get a COVID-19 test If you test positive for COVID-19, we recommend you self-isolate for at least 5 days, even if you only have mild symptoms, starting at Day 0. This includes if you have had COVID-19 before. Day 0 is the day your symptoms started, or when you tested positive, whichever came first. Isolation means not going to work or school. If you have COVID-19 To further help reduce the spread of COVID-19 to others: wash your hands often sneeze and cough into your elbow disinfect shared surfaces often. If you do not have symptoms anymore and you feel well after your 5 days of isolation, you can return to your normal activities. Because you can remain infectious for up to 10 days, w e recommend you wear a mask if you need to: visit a healthcare facility visit an aged residential care facility have contact with anyone at risk of getting seriously unwell. You should discuss your return to work with your employer or your child’s return to school with their school principal. They may require additional precautions. If you still feel unwell after isolating at home for 5 days, we recommend you stay home until you have recovered. What to do when your isolation ends If you are eligible, you do not need to pay for COVID-19-related medical costs or healthcare when you get COVID-19. If you develop long COVID and need further appointments, you will need to pay for your visits to your doctor as you normally would. This includes prescription dispensing fees. Eligible people include: people with certain high-risk medical conditions Māori Pacific peoples some disabled people those aged 65 and over anyone else that meets the criteria for access to antiviral medicines refugees and asylum seekers people experiencing homelessness or who are in transitional housing people living in certain remote and rural locations who do not have easy access to healthcare services. High-risk medical conditions Who can get antivirals For most people reinfection with COVID-19 is not likely to be more severe than previous infections. But you can experience different symptoms. Every time you get COVID-19, it increases your risk of getting long COVID and other medical issues. If you do get COVID-19 again you will have access to the same advice, help and support you would receive for a new COVID-19 infection. If you get COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 28 days or fewer since your previous infection: if you are at low risk of serious illness, you do not need to take a RAT we recommend you stay home until you are recovered. If you have an underlying health condition or have symptoms of COVID-19 that are getting worse, you should get advice from a health practitioner or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . If you have COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 29 days or more since a previous infection, you should test with a RAT. Get a COVID-19 test If i t is positive, you should stay at home and follow the same advice as for your first infection.  We recommended you isolate for at least 5 days, and follow the advice for people who have COVID-19. If you have COVID-19 If your test is negative: your symptoms could be another illness, such as a cold or flu and your symptoms continue, you should repeat a RAT 48 hours later if your result is still negative, stay home until you have recovered. COVID-19 is spread from person to person. When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs, sneezes or sings, they may spread particles containing the virus. These particles range in size. Larger and heavier particles — droplets — quickly fall to the ground or other surfaces within seconds or minutes. Smaller particles — aerosols — can remain airborne for minutes to hours. COVID-19 is mostly spread by aerosols, which is why clean air and good ventilation is important. Getting COVID-19 off surfaces is less common, but it is still important to clean surfaces to reduce the risk. The risk of airborne transmission becomes higher: in enclosed spaces that do not have good airflow in crowded places with many people nearby in close-contact situations, such as close-range conversations, singing, or shouting. The risk is lower outside, with fewer people, and if people are widely spread. Long COVID describes the symptoms that continue or develop after the initial COVID-19 symptoms. This is usually longer than 12 weeks after a person is first infected. Most people who get COVID-19 recover from the acute signs and symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks. And they should be back to all activities they were doing before COVID-19 by 12 weeks. However, some people report a range of symptoms beyond the standard time of recovery. Symptoms of long COVID can persist for weeks or sometimes months. For support with the management and treatment of long COVID, seek help from your doctor or healthcare team. Long COVID Healthy habits can slow the spread of the virus and help protect you, your whānau, and your community from COVID-19. Healthy habits include handwashing and wearing a face mask in healthcare settings and crowded indoor places. Healthy habits Getting vaccinated means if you have COVID-19, you are far less likely to: get very sick need to go to hospital infect other people. While a 2-dose course provides some protection against severe disease from Omicron, this protection can decrease over time.

Home Prepare and stay safe About COVID-19 What is COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- COVID-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It affects your lungs, airways and other organs. Coronaviruses are a large and diverse family of viruses that cause illnesses such as the common cold. Other recent diseases caused by coronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS-CoV-2 was first recognised in China and likely originated in animals. It is still unclear how the virus came to infect humans. The disease spread to other countries, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus has since undergone genetic mutations over time as it adapts to humans. Some of these mutations can spread more easily than the original virus. It is a natural process for viruses to change or mutate, which may produce variants. Variants are developing around the world. This tends to happen in places where the virus is out of control. WHO is tracking variants of concern and variants of interest. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants | World Health Organization (external link) Variants of COVID-19 may affect how fast the virus spreads, or how sick people get from the virus. The Ministry of Health provides updates on variants and has a framework to prepare and respond to any new variants of concern. COVID-19 variants | Ministry of Health (external link) Omicron was first classified as a variant of concern by WHO in November 2021. It has spread worldwide and is now the major variant in many countries. Compared to Delta, Omicron: is more infectious causes similar symptoms, but because we have a highly vaccinated population, many people have milder or no symptoms (though could still pass the virus on to others) puts many more people in hospital, because Omicron can cause many more infections over a short period of time can still cause severe illness and even death, especially in people at high risk of serious illness, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions. Omicron, like other variants, continues to change. Variants and sub-variants in New Zealand include: BA.2 — dominant in early 2022 BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 — first detected in New Zealand in late April 2022 BA.2.75 — first detected in New Zealand in July 2022, may be slightly more infectious than BA.2. Although new variants of Omicron continue to emerge, there does not appear to have been a change in the severity of COVID-19. New Zealand's public health settings to manage current Omicron variants are appropriate for its subvariants. Omicron variants | Ministry of Health (external link) To identify which variant a person has, there needs to be whole-genome sequencing from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We encourage people arriving from overseas to do rapid antigen tests (RATs). Those who test positive should have a follow-up PCR test to identify the variant. Healthy habits can slow the spread of the virus and help protect you, your whānau, and your community from COVID-19. Healthy habits include handwashing and wearing a face mask in healthcare settings and crowded indoor places.

If you work in an area where there is a high risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as some healthcare settings, you can discuss and agree with your employer a risk assessment and options for different ways of working. If your child is immunocompromised, or at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, talk to their school or kura about whether changes can be made at their school. The best way to protect your tamariki is by getting them vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination advice for 5 to 11 year olds You can support friends and whānau by: meeting outside where there is better ventilation.

If it makes you feel more comfortable, you can ask them to wear a face mask. If you are gathering indoors, let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. Even though the number of people who can gather indoors has increased, organisers still need to follow public health guidelines to keep everyone safe. You could ask the organisers for a livestream option, if you feel more comfortable participating from home. Stay connected — if you are not ready to start socialising in large groups, find other ways to keep in touch with close friends and whānau. If you are at higher risk of severe illness, you can get free P2/N95 face masks when you pick up rapid antigen tests (RATs) from a testing centre. You do not need to be unwell or have COVID-19 symptoms. Find a collection centre near you on the Healthpoint website, or by calling 0800 222 478 and choosing option 1. Find a testing site that offers free face masks | Healthpoint (external link) (external link) Even if you have had COVID-19, you should still get any COVID-19 vaccinations you are eligible for. We recommend you wait 3 months after testing positive before getting any COVID-19 vaccination. If you are at high risk of getting seriously ill if you do test positive for COVID-19 again, we recommend you talk to your doctor or health professional for advice on the best timing for your vaccinations. You may be able to receive your vaccination sooner. --- Section Separator --- As restrictions ease, we encourage you to talk to your employer about flexible working arrangements. If you have been working from home for a long time, it can take a while to adjust back to working in an office or other workplace. Let your colleagues and employer know if there is something they can do to make working easier and safer for you. If you work in an area where there is a high risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as some healthcare settings, you can discuss and agree with your employer a risk assessment and options for different ways of working. If your child is immunocompromised, or at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, talk to their school or kura about whether changes can be made at their school.

Staying home if you are sick can stop the spread of COVID-19. If you have cold, flu or COVID-19 symptoms you should get a rapid antigen test (RAT) as soon as you start to feel unwell. Doing a RAT and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can be connected with any help and support you might need. It is also important to test before visiting people who are at higher risk and to not visit them if you have any symptoms, or if you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 5 days. Call your doctor or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 for advice about getting tested. COVID-19 symptoms How to get a COVID-19 test If you have COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- Face masks can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. They are a way we can protect ourselves and others. We recommend you wear a face mask when visiting healthcare services. They are also encouraged to be worn when in closed, crowded and confined spaces, with poor ventilation. A well–fitting face mask can help stop particles from spreading or being breathed in when someone speaks, laughs, coughs or sneezes. Non-valved respirator-type masks such as N95, KN95 or FFP2 masks also help prevent you from breathing in the virus. Wearing a face mask --- Section Separator --- Having COVID-19 does not provide the same level of immunity as getting vaccinated. We also know that your protection from the primary course of the vaccine decreases over time. To keep your immunity levels high, stay up to date with your vaccinations — including boosters. This will lower your chances of getting very sick from COVID-19 and ending up in hospital. Vaccination remains one of the best tools in the fight against COVID-19. Even if you have had COVID-19, getting a booster once enough time has passed gives you another layer of protection from the virus. Being up-to-date with your COVID-19 vaccinations also helps protect people who are more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus and people who cannot be vaccinated such as babies and children under 5 years old. You should wait 6 months after testing positive before getting a COVID-19 vaccination.

To slow the spread and continue to protect yourself, your whānau, and your community, it is important to keep up the healthy habits we know. --- Section Separator --- Risk of infection spreading between people still remains in certain locations such as: public transport — buses, trains, indoors on ferries and flights closed indoor spaces with poor ventilation crowded places close-contact settings, for example, if there are face-to-face conversations, shouting or singing. --- Section Separator --- You are not required to maintain physical distance from others. But it is still worthwhile keeping a safe distance from people while you are out and about. This will help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community. --- Section Separator --- Good ventilation helps remove COVID-19 virus particles in the air. We encourage you to let in fresh air every day, including after someone visits your home, shop or office. If you can, partly open a window about 5cm for most of the day. Or open windows for at least 15 minutes as often as possible, whenever it is practical to do so. If your windows do not open, check if your ventilation system filters (cleans) the air. Ventilation and COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- Cough or sneeze into your elbow or cover your mouth and nose with tissues. Put tissues in a bin immediately, then wash or sanitise your hands. --- Section Separator --- Washing or sanitising your hands is one of the easiest ways to keep yourself and others safe. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Then dry your hands completely. Using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser is also effective at killing germs and viruses. If using hand sanitiser, make sure you use enough product to cover your hands, rub it in and allow it to dry. You should wash or sanitise your hands if you have been in a public place, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching your face, including your eyes, nose or mouth, if your hands are not clean. Either way you clean your hands, it will kill the COVID-19 virus by bursting its protective bubble. Keeping your hands clean also prevents other types of germs and viruses. This is especially important if you are visiting vulnerable people. --- Section Separator --- Clean surfaces regularly. This includes frequently touched items like door handles, light switches and phones. When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they may spread particles containing the virus. These particles range in size. The larger and heavier particles or droplets can settle on surrounding surfaces. Use regular household cleaning products and follow instructions. Remember to store cleaners and disinfectants safely.

To be effective, a face mask should: cover your nose, mouth and chin be well-fitting so there are no gaps above, below or on the sides be used correctly and consistently not be damp, damaged or dirty. A face mask that is not worn correctly may become ineffective. It may not offer enough protection for you or those around you against COVID-19 spreading. How to wear a face mask safely Wearing a face mask Different types of face masks provide different levels of protection, depending on the type of mask. You should choose a face mask that best fits you and suits your needs. There are several things you should think about when choosing a face mask for you. This includes: your risk of illness from COVID-19 how well the face mask fits you layers and the filtration ability of the material comfort of the face mask. Disposable face masks with ear loops or ties can offer better protection for a longer period than fabric face masks. Especially when you are in a higher-risk indoor setting. These are the widely available ‘blue’ medical masks. They are often called ‘medical’, ‘surgical’ and ‘procedural’ masks. For use in healthcare, they must comply to a certain standard. Many medical masks may not be certified to medical standards, but still provide effective protection. You can find these at many retail stores, supermarkets or pharmacies. Some relevant social services agencies or organisations may also be able to provide some. To make these masks fit better and get a snug fit: pinch the nose wire place a fabric mask over top knot the ear loops where they attach to the mask, then fold and tuck excess material under the edges try pulling the ear loops back and securing them with a hair tie or clip. How to wear a face mask correctly Try to avoid twisting the ear loop into a figure 8, as this will likely cause a side gap that could let virus particles in. Double masking or layering can provide greater protection. The other layer, preferably a fabric mask, can help stop any leaks around the top and sides of the bottom mask. To reuse these masks, you can soak them in warm, hot or boiling water for a few minutes and hang them out to dry. You can do this up to 10 times. When they start to show wear or no longer have a good fit, dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. You can use a fabric face mask. The effectiveness of fabric face masks can vary depending on the style and materials used. You should look for reusable fabric face masks that have at least 3 layers and are made of tightly woven fabric, such as cotton. Ideally face masks should also use 2 different types of fabric that still allow easy breathing but provide filtration and a good fit. Face masks with more than one layer will help contain any respiratory droplets. You can increase protection of your fabric face mask by adding a ‘filter layer’ and a nose bridge wire to mould the face mask to your face. A filter layer could be a specific face mask filter or a cut-down disposable face mask to add to a face mask pocket. Fabric face masks can still be effective for short periods of time in well-ventilated areas. Taking care of your face mask is important. You should wash fabric face masks daily after use, using soap and hot water, and completely dry them before using again. You should have enough face masks to at least wash one and wear one. Check for wear and tear to make sure there are no holes and they are still in good condition. Many stores and online retailers offer these types of face masks. You can also make your own but make sure it has at least 3 layers. How to make a face covering Disposable high-filtration face masks or particulate respirators offer the highest level of protection when used correctly. For people who are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19, the use of a P2/N95 face mask may be a better choice for you. If you choose to wear this type of face mask, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to mould these face masks to your face. You need to make sure there are no gaps and you have a tight seal against your face. These face masks can offer hours of protection when in high-risk indoor settings where there is no or little ventilation. But they need to have a tight seal around the face to provide better protection than a well-fitting medical mask. In healthcare settings, these face masks work best when a person is ‘fit tested’ to make sure they have the right type of face mask that suits their face. Do not wash these face masks. These face masks have a special static charge that traps viruses. You can reuse these face masks several times if you leave them for a few days between each use in a cool, dry place. If they no longer provide a tight seal around your face, or are dirty or damaged, then you should dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. Particulate respirator face masks come in a variety of models, prices, availability and suitability. They are often identified by which international regulatory standard they meet. P2 is the Australia/New Zealand respiratory standard. N95 is the United States respiratory standard. KN95 is the Chinese respiratory standard. FFP2 is the European respiratory standard. Children aged 5 or under are generally not recommended to wear a mask. Children between 6 and 11 years of age are encouraged to wear a mask at the discretion and supervision of their caregiver. Choose a face mask for children that fits them best, is comfortable to wear and can be worn consistently. The face mask should cover their nose, mouth, and chin without gaps above, below or on the sides. This can be a reusable fabric mask with 3 layers or a medical disposable mask. Many fabric masks (either purchased or made) come in child sizes. For commonly available medical masks, you can use the knot and tuck technique to improve the fit to a child's face. How to make a face mask fit well These types of face masks or coverings provide very little protection against transmission of COVID-19. A face shield is not recommended to be worn instead of a face mask as it will provide very little protection against droplets or aerosols. Dust masks or particulate respirators that have a 1-way valve are not recommended as they can allow particles from you to spread to others. Masks that are showing wear and tear. If there is any thinning of the material, holes, or the ties or elastic loops can no longer keep the mask in place, you should replace it. --- Section Separator --- Some healthcare facilities and certain areas within healthcare facilities may ask visitors to wear a face mask.

If you choose to wear this type of face mask, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to mould these face masks to your face. You need to make sure there are no gaps and you have a tight seal against your face. These face masks can offer hours of protection when in high-risk indoor settings where there is no or little ventilation. But they need to have a tight seal around the face to provide better protection than a well-fitting medical mask. In healthcare settings, these face masks work best when a person is ‘fit tested’ to make sure they have the right type of face mask that suits their face. Do not wash these face masks. These face masks have a special static charge that traps viruses. You can reuse these face masks several times if you leave them for a few days between each use in a cool, dry place. If they no longer provide a tight seal around your face, or are dirty or damaged, then you should dispose of them in your general household rubbish bin. Particulate respirator face masks come in a variety of models, prices, availability and suitability. They are often identified by which international regulatory standard they meet. P2 is the Australia/New Zealand respiratory standard. N95 is the United States respiratory standard. KN95 is the Chinese respiratory standard. FFP2 is the European respiratory standard. --- Section Separator --- Children aged 5 or under are generally not recommended to wear a mask. Children between 6 and 11 years of age are encouraged to wear a mask at the discretion and supervision of their caregiver. Choose a face mask for children that fits them best, is comfortable to wear and can be worn consistently. The face mask should cover their nose, mouth, and chin without gaps above, below or on the sides. This can be a reusable fabric mask with 3 layers or a medical disposable mask. Many fabric masks (either purchased or made) come in child sizes. For commonly available medical masks, you can use the knot and tuck technique to improve the fit to a child's face. How to make a face mask fit well --- Section Separator --- These types of face masks or coverings provide very little protection against transmission of COVID-19. A face shield is not recommended to be worn instead of a face mask as it will provide very little protection against droplets or aerosols. Dust masks or particulate respirators that have a 1-way valve are not recommended as they can allow particles from you to spread to others. Masks that are showing wear and tear. If there is any thinning of the material, holes, or the ties or elastic loops can no longer keep the mask in place, you should replace it. --- Section Separator --- Face masks Wearing a face mask Types of face masks How to wear a face mask safely How to make a face mask Advice for people who have difficulties wearing a face mask Wearing a face mask Types of face masks How to wear a face mask safely How to make a face mask Advice for people who have difficulties wearing a face mask NZ COVID Tracer app Ventilation and COVID-19

Home Prepare and stay safe Protect yourself and others Ventilation and COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they may spread particles containing the virus. COVID-19 mostly spreads by aerosols — small virus particles that can stay in the air for minutes to hours. Good ventilation helps remove virus particles in the air. How COVID-19 spreads You can reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 by improving ventilation. If you test positive for COVID-19, we recommend you self-isolate at home and avoid contact with people in your household for at least 5 days, even if you only have mild symptoms. If you have COVID-19 Some people who have tested positive for COVID-19 can still be infectious for up to 10 days. So, it is important to keep the air in your room fresh. If you can, open windows on different sides of the room to help airflow. To stop virus particles spreading, reduce airflow from your room to other parts of your home: Block gaps under your door with a towel or draught stopper. Before opening the door into shared spaces, open your window for at least 5 minutes to freshen the air. Close the window before you open the door. In a shared bathroom or toilet, close the door after you have been in the room and switch on the extractor fan, or open a window. We encourage you to let in fresh air every day, including after someone visits your home. If you can, partly open a window about 5cm for most of the day. Or open windows for at least 15 minutes as often as possible, whenever it is practical to do so. Try 1 or more of these ways to remove stale air: Open windows or doors on opposite sides of a room to help airflow. Open doors between rooms to ventilate hallways and spaces without windows. In kitchens, bathrooms, and toilets, switch on the extractor fan or open a window. Open higher windows wider than lower windows. This helps reduce draughts. If your windows do not open, check if your ventilation system filters (cleans) the air. When leaving windows or doors open for periods of time, consider the safety of others — especially disabled people, children and pets. Steamed-up windows can be a sign of low ventilation. Try 1 or more of these ways to refresh air without letting rooms get chilly or damp: Partly open a window for most of the day, for example, a 5cm opening. Fully open a window or door for 3 to 5 minutes every hour. Open a window whenever you leave the room, closing the door behind you. You do not have to leave windows or doors open all the time. Heat pumps, air conditioners and ceiling fans do not refresh the air. Instead, they move around air already in a room. You will need to open doors or windows to remove stale air and let in fresh air. If you have a home ventilation system, check if it recycles air or filters air: If it recycles air, you need to open windows or doors to move stale air out and let in fresh air. If it filters or cleans air, this helps remove stale air and reduce the risk of virus particles spreading. Landlords must provide good ventilation. If you live in or own a rental property, check ventilation rules on the Tenancy Services website. Ventilation standard | Tenancy Services (external link) Virus particles can build up quickly in crowded places such as buses or trains. It helps to sit or stand close to the door as airflow will be better. Open a window on the bus if you can. Taxis and ride-share services often ask passengers to open windows.

Home Testing and isolation COVID-19 testing How to use a RAT --- Section Separator --- Get ready by blowing your nose and then washing and drying your hands. Lay out the contents of your RAT kit — a tube of solution, a stopper, a swab, and the test cassette. Remove the swab (it looks like a long cotton ear bud). Take the soft end and gently glide swab in 1 nostril, going low and slow, about 2 centimetres deep. Twirl the swab over the surface of the nostril around 5 times. Then repeat in your other nostril, going round again slowly 5 times. Get the tube with solution, open it, keep it upright and make sure not to spill it. Place the soft end of the swab into the solution and swirl about 5 times. You want to make sure that the swab is soaked. Pinch the swab as you are removing it — squeeze as much liquid out as you can, to keep it in the tube. Place the stopper firmly on the tube. Give the tube a shake or flick a couple of times so it gets a good mix. Then leave upright for about a minute. With the test cassette ready on a flat surface, take your tube (with the solution of your sample), and turn it upside down. Follow the kit instructions as to how many drops are needed for your test. Squeeze the drops through the stopper onto the well. Wait for 15 minutes — set a timer if that helps. Again, check with the kit instructions as the waiting time may differ. Check for results. If there is no line at the C (C for control), or there are 3 lines, then the test did not work properly this time (it is invalid — this sometimes happens). You will need to do another test. If you see a single line at the C, this shows that the test has worked and you are negative for COVID-19. If you see 2 lines (even if it is a faint line at the T) then this shows you have tested positive for COVID-19. You will need to isolate for 7 days. We recommend you isolate for at least 5 days, even if you have only mild symptoms, starting at Day 0. Day 0 is the day your symptoms started or when you tested positive, whichever came first. Please report your results (positive or negative): online: My Covid Record (external link) by calling: 0800 222 478 . Doing a test and reporting the result in My Covid Record means you can get the help you need as early as possible. How to report your RAT result You should dispose of your used RATs, and expired RATs that you can no longer use. For used RATs, place the test cassette, swab, tube of solution and stopper into your general household rubbish bin. Any cardboard packaging and instructions can then be placed into your recycling. For expired RAT kits, please recycle the cardboard packaging and instructions, and then place all other kit items in your general household rubbish bin.

Follow the isolation advice on the COVID-19 Health Hub.
Home Testing and isolation If you have COVID-19 After you have had COVID-19 --- Section Separator --- For most people reinfection with COVID-19 is not likely to be more severe than previous infections. But you can experience different symptoms. Every time you get COVID-19, it increases your risk of getting long COVID and other medical issues. If you do get COVID-19 again you will have access to the same advice, help and support you would receive for a new COVID-19 infection. If you get COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 28 days or fewer since your previous infection: if you are at low risk of serious illness, you do not need to take a RAT we recommend you stay home until you are recovered. If you have an underlying health condition or have symptoms of COVID-19 that are getting worse, you should get advice from a health practitioner or Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . If you have COVID-19 symptoms again and it has been 29 days or more since a previous infection, you should test with a RAT. Get a COVID-19 test If i t is positive, you should stay at home and follow the same advice as for your first infection.  We recommended you isolate for at least 5 days, and follow the advice for people who have COVID-19. If you have COVID-19 If your test is negative: your symptoms could be another illness, such as a cold or flu and your symptoms continue, you should repeat a RAT 48 hours later if your result is still negative, stay home until you have recovered. If you have had COVID-19 within the last 28 days, and someone in your household tests positive, you are not considered to be a Household Contact and you do not need to test. If it has been 29 days or longer since your COVID-19 infection and someone in your household tests positive, then you should test daily for 5 days. Household Contacts Long COVID describes the symptoms that continue or develop after the initial COVID-19 symptoms. This is usually longer than 12 weeks after a person is first infected. Most people who get COVID-19 recover from the acute signs and symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks. And they should be back to all activities they were doing before COVID-19 by 12 weeks. However, some people report a range of symptoms beyond the standard time of recovery. Symptoms of long COVID can persist for weeks or sometimes months. For support with the management and treatment of long COVID, seek help from your doctor or healthcare team. Long COVID Even if you have had COVID-19 or are vaccinated, you still need to keep up healthy habits. It is possible to get COVID-19 again. Keep up healthy habits Having COVID-19 does not provide the same level of immunity as getting vaccinated. We also know that your protection from the primary course of the vaccine decreases over time. To keep your immunity levels high, stay up to date with your vaccinations — including boosters. This will lower your chances of getting very sick from COVID-19 and ending up in hospital.

Home Testing and isolation If you have COVID-19 How to isolate --- Section Separator --- If you have tested positive for COVID-19, we recommend you isolate for 5 days, even if you only have mild symptoms, starting at Day 0. Day 0 is the day your symptoms started or when you tested positive, whichever came first. This means you should not go to work or school. If you do need to leave your home during your 5 day recommended isolation period, it is very important you take precautions to prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. You should wear a mask whenever you leave the house. You should not: visit a healthcare facility (except to access medical care) visit an aged residential care facility have contact with anyone at risk of getting seriously unwell with COVID-19. Some healthcare facilities and certain areas within healthcare facilities may ask visitors to wear a face mask. This is to protect those at higher risk, for example patients receiving care in an intensive care unit or emergency department of a hospital. To protect those at higher risk, respect and follow the healthcare facilities policies. You should discuss your return to work with your employer or your child’s return to school with their school principal. Your employer or your school may require additional precautions. Open windows to increase fresh air flow inside. The risk of spreading COVID-19 is highest in crowded and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.

Home Testing and isolation If you have COVID-19 Long COVID --- Section Separator --- You should expect to recover from the first signs and symptoms of COVID-19 within 2 to 4 weeks. You should be back to all activities you were doing before COVID-19 within 12 weeks. Yet, some people report a range of symptoms beyond the standard 12-week period. Long COVID is a general term used to describe symptoms that continue or develop beyond the standard time of recovery. In New Zealand, we divide long COVID into 2 groups: Ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 — you can experience signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for 4 to 12 weeks after your initial infection. Post-COVID-19 syndrome — when you have signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection. These continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by any other conditions. Long COVID can affect any system of the body, and the severity of symptoms may fluctuate over time. The type of symptoms someone experiences may also vary over time. Symptoms often improve over time. Anyone can develop long COVID, but it is more common if you had severe symptoms when you first got sick. A second COVID-19 infection could trigger long COVID. You are at more risk of getting long COVID if you: are aged 50 years and over have more than 1 underlying chronic medical condition are obese are female had many symptoms in your initial infection were admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19. Long COVID is less common in children and adolescents. Symptoms of long COVID can persist for weeks or sometimes months. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms are below. General symptoms include: fatigue fever abdominal pain joint pain muscle pain nausea and vomiting diarrhoea weight loss reduced appetite sleep issues. Cardiovascular symptoms include: chest tightness chest pain skipped, extra or irregular heartbeats (palpitations). Respiratory symptoms include: breathlessness cough. Neurological symptoms include: loss of concentration or memory issues (cognitive impairment, 'brain fog') headache sleep disturbance pins and needles and numbness dizziness delirium (in older people) lack of strength in arms or legs (mobility impairment) visual disturbance. Ear, nose and throat symptoms include: tinnitus earache sore throat dizziness loss of taste or smell blocked nose (nasal congestion). The best way to prevent long COVID is to prevent infection with COVID-19. Vaccines reduce the risk of long COVID by lowering the chances of getting COVID-19.

Some people with a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are eligible for treatment with COVID-19 antiviral medicines. These medicines reduce the amount of virus in your body, so you do not get as sick and you are less likely to go to hospital. You can get a prescription for antivirals from your doctor or hauora provider. Some pharmacies can supply antivirals without a prescription. You can get free antiviral medicines if you: have COVID-19 and symptoms or you are a Household Contact and have symptoms, and became sick within the last 5 days, and meet one of the additional antiviral eligibility criteria. Eligible people include: Māori or Pacific people aged 50 or over everyone aged 65 or over anyone aged 50 or over, who has not completed a primary course of vaccination anyone with a severely weakened immune system anyone with Down syndrome anyone with sickle cell disease anyone who has previously been in critical high dependency hospital care from COVID-19 anyone with 3 or more high-risk medical conditions. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or hauora provider if you think that you, or a member of your whānau may be eligible for antiviral medicines. COVID-19 antiviral medicines are available to treat eligible people with COVID-19 at home. You must start taking COVID-19 medicines within the first 5 days of becoming unwell with COVID-19.

Talk to your pharmacist or a registered nurse either immediately after you test positive or develop symptoms to see if the medicines are right for you. If you are at risk of becoming very unwell with COVID-19 you may be able to get a prescription before you get COVID-19. This means the pharmacist will have the prescription ready to use if you become unwell. If you test positive, you can then arrange to have the medicine delivered by your friends, whānau or the pharmacy. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will confirm that it is still safe for you to take COVID-19 medicines. You will not be able to get the medicine until you test positive for COVID-19. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or Hauora provider if you think that you, or a member of your whānau may be eligible for antiviral medicines. You can also ask if getting a prescription before you get unwell is right for you. Pharmacies supplying antivirals can be found on Healthpoint.
